                                            space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers. Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city. The phase out doesn't mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there. Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules sot they don't have to clog loading/ unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn't have to wait long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience. Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips. Use the Pasig River. They Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road.

In response to the growing problem of alcoholism in downtown Portland, the Burnside Consortium was created by the City of Portland and Multnomah County, with the purpose of administering a National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) Public Inebriate grant (Central City Concern, n.d.). The Consortium's early work focused on alcohol recovery treatment and affordable housing management and rehabilitation. 4. Rona, a social worker from San Jose encountered many cases of domestic violence. To help lessen the problem, she decided to do a research about the strategies to encourage women to report domestic violence cases. 5.

(For Carillo, Grospe, and Manlusoc only) Propaganda web: Pro-Marcos literature, sites, and online disinformation linked (Posted at Dec 12 2020 04:06 AM) Heritage sites in Ilocos Norte and propaganda books all promoting the “greatness" of dictator Ferdinand Marcos are linked to one another, a study by two University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman researchers from the Marcos Regime Research Group concluded. "The Marcoses, their loyalists, and other allies have been producing and reproducing propaganda all these years, with the intended effect of conferring a patina of well-researched scholarship to Marcos," Miguel Paolo P. Reyes, one of the researchers, explained during a webinar on Dec. 9 organized by The Consortium on Democracy and Disinformation (D&amp;D), De La Salle University Jesse M. Robredo Institute of Governance and the Asian Center for Journalism of Ateneo de Manila University 9 The study, which was also co-authored by Joel Ariate Jr., concluded that although current online disinformation favoring Marcos does not build up on written propaganda, it "saturates the audience wit all sorts of information up to a point that the propaganda effort appears to be without an author." "They let their sanctioned book and disinformation mingle with often more crude falsities online und amu their loyal hase" Reyes said​</h2><br />

                            14. space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers. Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city. The phase out doesn't mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there. Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules sot they don't have to clog loading/ unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn't have to wait long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience. Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips. Use the Pasig River. They Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road.

                        <p></p><p></p><p>The idea in the reading text that I agree with the least is the complete phase-out of jeepneys in Metro Manila. While it is true that jeepneys take up more road space and consume more fuel for the number of passengers they can accommodate, they still serve a vital role in providing transportation in areas with limited options. Instead of completely phasing out jeepneys, a more practical solution would be to regulate their routes and ensure they are only used in areas where they are most needed. Additionally, efforts could be made to modernize jeepneys to make them more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly.</p><br />

                            15. Sample 2 With diminishing finances, it is rarely possible for a library of information center to have enough resources to fulfil the needs of its clients... Collaboration is widely recognized as the best way for libraries to cope with the ever increasing challenges: volume of information resources, nature and quality of information, user needs and expectations, information and communication technology competencies and infrastructure, inflated cost of information resources and staffing needs. However, although these challenges have continued to prevail, libraries working under collaborative initiatives like the Consortium of Academic and research Libraries in Illinois (CARL) have registered tremendous success. This research reports the findings of a thorough study to establish the factors that have led to the success of CARLI and how such success factors can be applied in libraries of developing countries like Uganda. Emphasis is placed on the establishment of CARLI leadership, the sharing of responsibility and decision making process, as well as sources of funding for the consortium... Also central to the research study is exploration of the role and responsibility of participating member libraries and their contributions to and expectations from the consortium. This present study has incorporated interviews with CARLI staff and a questionnaire survey to all the participating CARLI membership.

                        <p>Para sa akin, mas mabuting makapasok ang Mislatel at iba pang kompanya sa merkado dahil magdudulot ito ng kompitesyon, at dahil sa kompitesyon ay mas bubuti ang serbisyo at mas mumura ang halaga ng mga produkto.
</p><p>Mahalaga ang kumpetisyon para sa matagumpay na operasyon ng isang ekonomiya sa merkado. Tumutulong ang kumpetisyon na magbigay ng pinakamahusay na mga produkto at serbisyo sa pinakamainam na presyo. Sa sagot na ito, malalaman mo ang tungkol sa kompetisyon at ilang mga diskarte na ginagamit ng mga kakumpitensya.
</p><p>Ang kumpetisyon sa merkado ay tulad ng digmaan, at ang layunin ay kumpleto ang pagdomina. Ang tanging problema ng may ka-kompetensya ay ang lahat ng kanyang mga katunggali ay nais ang parehong bagay. At tulad ng modernong digma, may ilang malinaw na itinatag na mga patakaran ng pakikipag-ugnay.
</p><p>Ang mga pamahalaan, kahit na sa pinaka libre ng mga libreng merkado ng merkado, ay nagtatag ng mga linya na hindi maaaring tumawid ang mga negosyo. Kasama sa mga halimbawa ang mga batas sa proteksyon ng mamimili laban sa pandaraya at maling batas at mga batas sa intelektuwal na pag-aari na pumipigil sa isang negosyo mula sa pagtanggal ng intelektwal na ari-arian ng ibang negosyo, tulad ng mga patent, copyright at trademark.
