After throwing and catching the ball for aI want you to stay outdoors and play "Catch the Ball" with your sibling or friend.

For instance, if you keep feeling fearful do you need to stayin fier for long? How helpful is fear to you? How accurate or appropriate is the feeling of anxiety, now? How helpful is itto always be worrying about things? While thinking about this, Breathe in and Breathe out (5x).replace that feeling some feelings are productive and useful while some may be unproductive and useless. It is becauseCharume that feeling in this part, I want you to think of something else to help you feel better. This means that you canthey are no longer appropriate to the situation.

As we experiment, many of us were confused on how to answer each problem in the said activity. We also do have many questions to each of those problems. On how or where to get the answers of each problems in our experiment. We share our ideas to each other on how we would do it. While we were doing our activity I feel the excitement, because apart from problem solving it is also an experiment that I can learn so that in college i am advanced. In this activity I learned many different types of wavelengths. I also learn how polarization affects an image that is visible. I can say that this experiment has been difficult for our group because it is an online experiment due to today's pandemic</a>

As we experiment, many of us were confused on how to answer each problem in the said activity. We also do have many questions to each of those problems. On how or where to get the answers of each problems in our experiment. We share our ideas to each other on how we would do it. While we were doing our activity I feel the excitement, because apart from problem solving it is also an experiment that I can learn so that in college i am advanced. In this activity I learned many different types of wavelengths. I also learn how polarization affects an image that is visible. I can say that this experiment has been difficult for our group because it is an online experiment due to today's pandemic</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As we all know, experimenting one another is very difficult due to this pandemic, yeah we can share ideas but we can't work each other cause by COVID 19 but it's okay for me or with us to do this experiment because it is a challenge for us to do this work. I learned a lot in this kind of activities and apparently this is for our own good at the same time, as long as we knew it and we can do it. If I say so, I'm really excited to finished this experiment or I can say so much excited cause I don't know what will happen to this activity but I will do it for our good , so by the present or in future I know already the processing of my duties in experiment. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it helps</p><p></p>#carry-on learning<p></p>BABIES KO:&gt;<br />
