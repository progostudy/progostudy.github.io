I was in love with her, but now she is gone, and I didn't get to tell her how I feel about her. I still miss her, but I know she will never come back. My question is... has anyone met or seen her in a while? if so than please,tell me. And Abigail, if your out there, its me, Luis Ayala, and I need you to come back to me... I love you.</a>

Do you already have an assignment in Math? STUDENT B:	Oh yes! My brother helped me did it, How about you? STUDENT A: I don’t have my assignment yet because I didn’t know how to solve the problems. Could you help me later? STUDENT B:	Sure. STUDENT C:	Don’t worry about it! Why don’t we talk about our project in English? STUDENT A: I think that’s a good idea! Our professor told us to do a digital presentation about the signs and symptoms of Covid19. STUDENT B: That’s right, but we still have to decide how we will be grouped. Will it be by rows or by course? STUDENT C: I know but we have to start discussing the details of our presentation so that we already have an idea on how to go about it. What do you think? STUDENT A:	I’m really worried about my assignment in English—I mean in Math. STUDENT B: Ok let’s go back to our assignment in Math. During our break time I will explain to you the problems one by one so you will understand and I will show you the computation step by step. STUDENT C: It’s time for our Science class now. Miss Cruz is coming. Thank you for your time. STUDENT B:	We will see you later. ​</a>

The one day I spent in Morocco, Africa was an experience of a lifetime. When finally reached Morocco and got off the bus, there were four little girls standing shoeless in the hot sun. After I swallowed my tears, I could not even try to picture this in America as it is no something you often see in the U.S. Meanwhile my tourist guide instructed me not to give them money as it encouraged the children to beg, however, I was wearing four silver bracelets. My father's name is Robert Chan, he died on Aug 28th, 2003 of a heart attaci It was about six in the morning I was sleeping restlessly, and the phone rang, and I missed then it rang again. I saw it was my father's house calling to get me up for the first day of scho To my surprise it was my stepmother crying on the other line. This was the start of the wor day of my life in the short seventeen years I had been alive. 3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool a fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on beach. The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, bu is a pleasant noise, I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel relax and peaceful. When i want to relax in summer, I go to the beach. 4. As Chad Reed pulled into the pits, you could tell just by looking at him that had been a grueling race. His dirt bike was plastered with so much brown, wet, sticky mud you could not even read the number plates. His boots, resting comfortably on the foot pe were a mess of muddy brown dirt, bright white plastic, and black buckles. His riding pants w soaked and covered with mud on the front, while the back remained a brilliant white and blue. 5. The much-advertised meteor shows this summer was a memory of behold. TI air was crisp and cool. I did not even feel a hint of a breeze on my skin as I lie on my back in darkness. The warm temperature of the water against the cooler air created a drifting airy 1 that whispered over the lake. Darkness enveloped the sky as only a slight curve of the mo shone in the night; consequently, this made the perfect stage for the breathtaking view twinkling stars.​</a>

                                            The Man Who Can't Be Move
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

                                            Summarize the given Text belowThe Boy Who Became a Stone One day, a little boy named Eloden sat out in the yard making a bird snare. As he worked, a little bird called to him. Tik-tik-lo-den (come and catch me). "I am making a snare for you," said the boy, but the bird continued to call until the snare was finished. Then Eloden ran and threw the snare over the bird and caught it. He put it in a jar in his house while he went with the other boys to swim. While he was away, his grandmother grew hungry, so she ate the bird, and when Eloden returned and found that his bird was gone, he was so sad that he wished he might go away and never come back. He went out into the forest and walked along a distance until finally, he came to big a stone and said, "Stone, open your mouth and eat me." And the stone opened its mouth and swallowed the boy. When his grandmother missed the boy, she went out and looked everywhere, hoping to find him. Finally, she passed near the stone and it cried out, "Here he is." Then the old woman tried to open the stone but she could not, so she called the horses to come and help her. They came and kicked it, but it would not break. Then she called the carabaos and they hooked it, but they only broke their horns. She called the chickens which pecked it, and the thunder which shook it, but nothing could open it, and she had to go home without the boy.​</a>

                                            He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                                            Summarize the given text belowThe Boy Who Became a StoneOne day, a little boy named Eloden sat out in the yard making a bird snare. As he worked, a little bird called to him. Tik-tik-lo-den (come and catch me). "I am making a snare for you," said the boy, but the bird continued to call until the snare was finished. Then Eloden ran and threw the snare over the bird and caught it. He put it in a jar in his house while he went with the other boys to swim. While he was away, his grandmother grew hungry, so she ate the bird, and when Eloden returned and found that his bird was gone, he was so sad that he wished he might go away and never come back. He went out into the forest and walked along a distance until finally, he came to big a stone and said, "Stone, open your mouth and eat me." And the stone opened its mouth and swallowed the boy. When his grandmother missed the boy, she went out and looked everywhere, hoping to find him. Finally, she passed near the stone and it cried out, "Here he is." Then the old woman tried to open the stone but she could not, so she called the horses to come and help her. They came and kicked it, but it would not break. Then she called the carabaos and they hooked it, but they only broke their horns. She called the chickens which pecked it, and the thunder which shook it, but nothing could open it, and she had to go home without the boy.​</a>

Mystery of the Missing Bike I already put Timmy down for a nap. You can listen for him over the baby monitor." Manah was watching Timmy, a nine-month old, while his mother ran errands. "Okay thanks. Mrs. Marcos. I'll stay right by the monitor here in the family room." Marian checked the volume on the baby monitor then settled into a chair with her favorite book. Half an hour later, Mariah heard the baby siir, and start to cry. "Coming. Timmy!" Mariah walked up the stairs and turned into the room Timmy shared with his teenage brother, Tony. She pulled Timmy from his crib changed his diaper, and took him downstairs to feed him. Just as she put Timmy in his high char, Mariah was startled to hear a voice over the baby monitor. "Yeah, I'll do it. I'll prove that I can take a dare by stealing a bike" Mariah had no time to react. Mrs. Marcos was coming in the back door with bogs of groceries. Here, Mrs. Marcos, let me help you." When Mariah returned home, her brother, Brandon, was sitting at the kitchen table drinking chocolate milk. Brandon's best friend, Jett, sat on the counter. "I'd like some of that milk too." said Jett "Maybe I'll go down to the comer store and get some. Guess what happened while I was baby-sitting Timmy?" Marian asked them. "I heard someone say they were going to steal a bicycle. The voice was coming from the baby monitor in Timmy's room. "I bet it was his brother, Tony said Jelf. He hangs out with some sort of a rough guys. Look. I see them walking past the house now." READ LIKE A DETECTIVE​</a>

                                            Let Us Try Read each of the items carefully and identify the text type. Write D if it is Descriptive and N if it is a narrative. 1. The one day I spent in Morocco, Africa was an experience of a lifetime. When I finally reached Morocco and got off the bus, there were four little girls standing shoeless in the hot sun. After I swallowed my tears, I could not even try to picture this in America as it is not something you often see in the U.S. Meanwhile my tourist guide instructed me not to give them money as it encouraged the children to beg; however, I was wearing four silver bracelets. 2. My father's name is Robert Chan, he died on Aug 28th, 2003 of a heart attack. It was about six in the morning I was sleeping restlessly, and the phone rang, and I missed it then it rang again. I saw it was my father's house calling to get me up for the first day of school. To my surprise it was my stepmother crying on the other line. This was the start of the worst day of my life in the short seventeen years I had been alive. 3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool and fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on the beach. The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, but it is a pleasant noise, I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel relaxed and peaceful. When I want to relax in summer, I go to the beach. 4. As Chad Reed pulled into the pits, you could tell just by looking at him that this had been a grueling race. His dirt bike was plastered with so much brown, wet, sticky mud that you could not even read the number plates. His boots, resting comfortably on the foot pegs, were a mess of muddy brown dirt, bright white plastic, and black buckles. His riding pants were soaked and covered with mud on the front, while the back remained a brilliant white and blue. 5. The much-advertised meteor shows this summer was a memory of behold. The air was crisp and cool. I did not even feel a hint of a breeze on my skin as I lie on my back in the darkness. The warm temperature of the water against the cooler air created a drifting airy fog that whispered over the lake. Darkness enveloped the sky as only a slight curve of the moon shone in the night; consequently, this made the perfect stage for the breathtaking view of twinkling stars.PS:Descriptive paragraph - describes a thing, a person, or a place. Narrative paragraph - tells a story or an event. (should be arrange chronologically-time order, that is in order in which they have happened) ​</a>

Discourse
Directions: Read and understand the song. Then, answer the questions in the chart. (5 points)
Going back to the corner where I first saw you Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand I'm not broke I'm just a broken hearted man
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do How can I move on when I'm still in love with you
Chorus:
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving Policeman says son you can't stay here
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go
Repeat Chorus
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving. I'm not moving, I'm not moving People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl, oh whoa There are no holes in his shoes But a big hole in his world
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved. I'm the man who can't be moved
Repeat Chorus 2x
Going back to the corner where I first saw you. Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move.

                                            The Harvest That Never CameA long time ago, the Swedish and Danish people were great friends, which was just as well, as their countries were next to each other. Arild Ugerup was the son of a noble Danish family He had a sweetheart, Thale Thott, and they planned to marry soon. But before the couple could make the arrangements, King Erik of Sweden declared war on the Danish people and Arild was captured. Poor Arild was thrown into a dark prison cell and left there alone. He greatly missed his home, his family, and his sweetheart Thale. Arild wondered whether he would ever get to see them again. Then one day, his jailer handed him a letterMy dearest Arild,You know how much I miss you and wish that I could be with you, even for just one hour. Now, I must bring you bad news. My father wants me to marry soon and he says that, as there is no chance of your coming home, I must marry a nobleman from the next village. I fear I will never see you again, dear Arild. It is a terrible thing, but I must obey my father.Your sweetheart,Thale ThottArild was infuriated at what he read. He threw himself at the bolts of the prison door and shook the bars of his prison windows. In his desperation, he even tried to dig a way out through the floor. "If only I were stronger, I could break out of here and go to Thale." That night when he had calmed down, he thought of a better way to do things. "I'll never be strong enough to break out of here. But I can find a way out using my mind." Dipping his pen in an inkwell, he began to write Your Majesty,I know that I am your prisoner. But for the sake of the friendship between us, grant this boon. I have a sweetheart who I must marry soon or stand losing her. I beg Your Majesty to let me go home to marry her. I will stay only as long as it takes to plant and harvest a crop---for it would not be right to leave my wife as soon as we are married. I solemnly swear that after harvesting the crop, I will come straight back to prison. Before long, King Erik's consent came. All went according to Arild's plan. Thale and him were married. Spring, the time for planting, arrived. In a few short months, Arild would have to harvest his crop and return to captivity To stall his return, he thought long and hard on which crop to plant. Then, he went out to the fields and planted each seed of his chosen crop six footsteps apart. Months passed and the once-green leaves shriveled and turned brown. A messenger arrived to escort Arild back to his prison cell. "The King has kept his part of the bargain. Now it is time for you to keep yours, Arild Ugerup," he told Arild. "But my crop has not even sprouted yet, much less been harvested!" The messenger was astounded at this reply. "Not yet sprouted! What in the world did you plant?" "Pine trees." The messenger rushed back to King Erik's court and relayed all that had happened to His Majesty. Upon hearing Arild's cunning, rhe king laughed. "Such a man does not deserve to remain a prisoner!"And Arild stayed with the wife he had fought for so hard. And around his land, a lush green forest attest to his devotion to her.1. If you were Arild, how would you feel after reading Thale's letter? What conflicts does he face?________________________________________________________________2. Why do you think King Erik agreed to the request?________________________________________________________________3. Do you think Arild was a true friend to King Erik?________________________________________________________________4. Why do you think the author starts the story with the letter that you read along with arild?________________________________________________________________​</a>

My father's name is Robert Chan, he died on Aug 28th, 2003 of a heart attaci It was about six in the morning I was sleeping restlessly, and the phone rang, and I missed then it rang again.

This was the start of the wor day of my life in the short seventeen years I had been alive. 3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool a fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on beach. The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, bu is a pleasant noise, I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel relax and peaceful. When i want to relax in summer, I go to the beach. 4. As Chad Reed pulled into the pits, you could tell just by looking at him that had been a grueling race. His dirt bike was plastered with so much brown, wet, sticky mud you could not even read the number plates. His boots, resting comfortably on the foot pe were a mess of muddy brown dirt, bright white plastic, and black buckles. His riding pants w soaked and covered with mud on the front, while the back remained a brilliant white and blue. 5. The much-advertised meteor shows this summer was a memory of behold. TI air was crisp and cool. I did not even feel a hint of a breeze on my skin as I lie on my back in darkness. The warm temperature of the water against the cooler air created a drifting airy 1 that whispered over the lake. Darkness enveloped the sky as only a slight curve of the mo shone in the night; consequently, this made the perfect stage for the breathtaking view twinkling stars.​</h2><br />

                            8. The Man Who Can't Be Move
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

                            13. Summarize the given Text belowThe Boy Who Became a Stone One day, a little boy named Eloden sat out in the yard making a bird snare. As he worked, a little bird called to him. Tik-tik-lo-den (come and catch me). "I am making a snare for you," said the boy, but the bird continued to call until the snare was finished. Then Eloden ran and threw the snare over the bird and caught it. He put it in a jar in his house while he went with the other boys to swim. While he was away, his grandmother grew hungry, so she ate the bird, and when Eloden returned and found that his bird was gone, he was so sad that he wished he might go away and never come back. He went out into the forest and walked along a distance until finally, he came to big a stone and said, "Stone, open your mouth and eat me." And the stone opened its mouth and swallowed the boy. When his grandmother missed the boy, she went out and looked everywhere, hoping to find him. Finally, she passed near the stone and it cried out, "Here he is." Then the old woman tried to open the stone but she could not, so she called the horses to come and help her. They came and kicked it, but it would not break. Then she called the carabaos and they hooked it, but they only broke their horns. She called the chickens which pecked it, and the thunder which shook it, but nothing could open it, and she had to go home without the boy.​</h2><br />

                            16. He Left So I Could Learn It was my second day on the job. I was sitting in my seemingly gilded cubicle, overlooking Manhattan, and pinching my right arm to make sure it was real. I landed an internship at Condé Nast Traveler. Every aspiring writer I’ve ever known secretly dreamt of an Anthony Bourdain lifestyle. Travel the world and write about its most colorful pockets. When my phone rang, and it was Mom telling me Dad had a heart attack. He didn’t make it. I felt as though the perfectly carpeted floors had dropped out from under me. Now that I’ve come out the other side, I realize Dad left me with a hefty stack of teachings. Here are three ideals I know he would’ve liked for me to embrace. First, you have to stand on your own two feet. As much as our parents love and support us, they can’t go to our school and confess to the principal that we stole a candy bar from Sara. We have to do that. Neither can they walk into the Condé Nast office and nail a job interview for us. At some point, we have to put on our “big girl pants” and be brave, even if we’re not. Also, there’s a difference between love and co-dependence. Being grateful to have someone to turn to for love and support is not the same as needing someone to turn to for love and support. With the loss of my father, I’ve also lost my sounding board. All I can glean from that is it’s time to look within myself and make proper assessments. If I can’t make sound decisions with the tools already in my kit, then I risk falling for anything. Finally, memories are, perhaps, the only item that cannot be taken away from us. Will I miss my father? Every single day. What can I do in those times? I can open up our suitcase of memories, pick out my favorite one, and dream about it, talk about it, or write about it. Maybe I can’t pick up the phone and call him anymore, but that doesn’t mean he’s gone. Next week, I’m off to Istanbul to explore their art scene. As soon as I read the email from my editor, I picked up my phone to call Dad. Then, I realized he’ll never answer my calls again. I fought back the tears, got up to make a cup of peppermint tea, and added a new note to my iPhone titled, “Istanbul Packing List.” In the end, life goes on. I’m not sure why he had to leave during the single most poignant chapter in my life. So, I won’t dwell on that. Instead, I’ll hold tightly to these three ideals and write about Karaköy in Istanbul’s Beyoğlu district. Dad will be with me every step of the way.

                            19. Summarize the given text belowThe Boy Who Became a StoneOne day, a little boy named Eloden sat out in the yard making a bird snare. As he worked, a little bird called to him. Tik-tik-lo-den (come and catch me). "I am making a snare for you," said the boy, but the bird continued to call until the snare was finished. Then Eloden ran and threw the snare over the bird and caught it. He put it in a jar in his house while he went with the other boys to swim. While he was away, his grandmother grew hungry, so she ate the bird, and when Eloden returned and found that his bird was gone, he was so sad that he wished he might go away and never come back. He went out into the forest and walked along a distance until finally, he came to big a stone and said, "Stone, open your mouth and eat me." And the stone opened its mouth and swallowed the boy. When his grandmother missed the boy, she went out and looked everywhere, hoping to find him. Finally, she passed near the stone and it cried out, "Here he is." Then the old woman tried to open the stone but she could not, so she called the horses to come and help her. They came and kicked it, but it would not break. Then she called the carabaos and they hooked it, but they only broke their horns. She called the chickens which pecked it, and the thunder which shook it, but nothing could open it, and she had to go home without the boy.​</h2><br />

Half an hour later, Mariah heard the baby siir, and start to cry. "Coming. Timmy!" Mariah walked up the stairs and turned into the room Timmy shared with his teenage brother, Tony. She pulled Timmy from his crib changed his diaper, and took him downstairs to feed him. Just as she put Timmy in his high char, Mariah was startled to hear a voice over the baby monitor. "Yeah, I'll do it. I'll prove that I can take a dare by stealing a bike" Mariah had no time to react. Mrs. Marcos was coming in the back door with bogs of groceries. Here, Mrs. Marcos, let me help you." When Mariah returned home, her brother, Brandon, was sitting at the kitchen table drinking chocolate milk. Brandon's best friend, Jett, sat on the counter.

Iking : Yes. Here’s a letter for your father. It must be from your brother Efren. It came from Manila. Here. Take it.
Ninay : Thank you, Mang Iking. I will give this to Father. I’m sure he will be glad to receive news from Kuya Efren. He has been away for more than a month already and we miss him very much.
Iking : He is now studying in Manila, isn’t he?
Ninay : Yes. He wants to be an engineer and I’m sure he will be someday!

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The letter is from Efren, the son who is studying in Manila, and it contains his message of love and gratitude towards his family, particularly his father who has endured poverty for so long.The eldest son, Gardo, interpreted the letter positively and with a proud tone of voice. He was not jealous of his brother and instead, he seemed to admire Efren's dedication to his studies and his desire to help lift their family from poverty.The mother, Sepa, interpreted the letter with a loving and emotional tone of voice. She expressed her admiration for Efren's character and considered him a good son. While not all mothers may react in the same way, it is common for parents to feel proud and emotional when receiving messages from their children who are away from home.Both interpretations are valid and can be considered close to Efren's intention. The letter expresses Efren's love and gratitude towards his family, as well as his determination to succeed and help his family overcome poverty. It is possible that Efren intended to convey both the positive emotions and the message of hope for a better future that his family can have with his success.Both interpretations are likable, as they show different perspectives and emotions that can arise from reading a letter from a loved one who is far away. However, the interpretation that focuses on Efren's determination to succeed and help his family can be particularly inspiring and hopeful for others who may also be struggling with poverty or other challenges in their lives.<p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>google nyo po para malaman mo</p><br />

                            24. Let Us Try Read each of the items carefully and identify the text type. Write D if it is Descriptive and N if it is a narrative. 1. The one day I spent in Morocco, Africa was an experience of a lifetime. When I finally reached Morocco and got off the bus, there were four little girls standing shoeless in the hot sun. After I swallowed my tears, I could not even try to picture this in America as it is not something you often see in the U.S. Meanwhile my tourist guide instructed me not to give them money as it encouraged the children to beg; however, I was wearing four silver bracelets. 2. My father's name is Robert Chan, he died on Aug 28th, 2003 of a heart attack. It was about six in the morning I was sleeping restlessly, and the phone rang, and I missed it then it rang again. I saw it was my father's house calling to get me up for the first day of school. To my surprise it was my stepmother crying on the other line. This was the start of the worst day of my life in the short seventeen years I had been alive. 3. The beach is the perfect place for me. The air is hot, but the water is cool and fresh. I enjoy swimming and surfing the ocean. When I am tired, I come out and lie on the beach. The sand is soft and white. The beach is noisy with seagulls and children laughing, but it is a pleasant noise, I even like the beach smells. The air smells salty from the sea. I feel relaxed and peaceful. When I want to relax in summer, I go to the beach. 4. As Chad Reed pulled into the pits, you could tell just by looking at him that this had been a grueling race. His dirt bike was plastered with so much brown, wet, sticky mud that you could not even read the number plates. His boots, resting comfortably on the foot pegs, were a mess of muddy brown dirt, bright white plastic, and black buckles. His riding pants were soaked and covered with mud on the front, while the back remained a brilliant white and blue. 5. The much-advertised meteor shows this summer was a memory of behold. The air was crisp and cool. I did not even feel a hint of a breeze on my skin as I lie on my back in the darkness. The warm temperature of the water against the cooler air created a drifting airy fog that whispered over the lake. Darkness enveloped the sky as only a slight curve of the moon shone in the night; consequently, this made the perfect stage for the breathtaking view of twinkling stars.PS:Descriptive paragraph - describes a thing, a person, or a place.

Going back to the corner where I first saw you Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand I'm not broke I'm just a broken hearted man
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do How can I move on when I'm still in love with you
Chorus:
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving Policeman says son you can't stay here
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go
Repeat Chorus
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving. I'm not moving, I'm not moving People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl, oh whoa There are no holes in his shoes But a big hole in his world
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved. I'm the man who can't be moved
Repeat Chorus 2x
Going back to the corner where I first saw you. Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move.

                            30. The Harvest That Never CameA long time ago, the Swedish and Danish people were great friends, which was just as well, as their countries were next to each other. Arild Ugerup was the son of a noble Danish family He had a sweetheart, Thale Thott, and they planned to marry soon. But before the couple could make the arrangements, King Erik of Sweden declared war on the Danish people and Arild was captured. Poor Arild was thrown into a dark prison cell and left there alone. He greatly missed his home, his family, and his sweetheart Thale. Arild wondered whether he would ever get to see them again. Then one day, his jailer handed him a letterMy dearest Arild,You know how much I miss you and wish that I could be with you, even for just one hour. Now, I must bring you bad news. My father wants me to marry soon and he says that, as there is no chance of your coming home, I must marry a nobleman from the next village. I fear I will never see you again, dear Arild. It is a terrible thing, but I must obey my father.Your sweetheart,Thale ThottArild was infuriated at what he read. He threw himself at the bolts of the prison door and shook the bars of his prison windows. In his desperation, he even tried to dig a way out through the floor. "If only I were stronger, I could break out of here and go to Thale." That night when he had calmed down, he thought of a better way to do things. "I'll never be strong enough to break out of here. But I can find a way out using my mind." Dipping his pen in an inkwell, he began to write Your Majesty,I know that I am your prisoner. But for the sake of the friendship between us, grant this boon. I have a sweetheart who I must marry soon or stand losing her. I beg Your Majesty to let me go home to marry her. I will stay only as long as it takes to plant and harvest a crop---for it would not be right to leave my wife as soon as we are married. I solemnly swear that after harvesting the crop, I will come straight back to prison. Before long, King Erik's consent came. All went according to Arild's plan. Thale and him were married. Spring, the time for planting, arrived. In a few short months, Arild would have to harvest his crop and return to captivity To stall his return, he thought long and hard on which crop to plant. Then, he went out to the fields and planted each seed of his chosen crop six footsteps apart. Months passed and the once-green leaves shriveled and turned brown. A messenger arrived to escort Arild back to his prison cell. "The King has kept his part of the bargain. Now it is time for you to keep yours, Arild Ugerup," he told Arild. "But my crop has not even sprouted yet, much less been harvested!" The messenger was astounded at this reply. "Not yet sprouted! What in the world did you plant?" "Pine trees." The messenger rushed back to King Erik's court and relayed all that had happened to His Majesty. Upon hearing Arild's cunning, rhe king laughed. "Such a man does not deserve to remain a prisoner!"And Arild stayed with the wife he had fought for so hard. And around his land, a lush green forest attest to his devotion to her.1. If you were Arild, how would you feel after reading Thale's letter? What conflicts does he face?________________________________________________________________2. Why do you think King Erik agreed to the request?________________________________________________________________3. Do you think Arild was a true friend to King Erik?________________________________________________________________4. Why do you think the author starts the story with the letter that you read along with arild?________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. If you were Arild, how would you feel after reading Thale's letter? What conflicts does he face?</p><p></p><p><strong>If I were Arild, I would feel devastated and heartbroken after reading Thale's letter. I would also feel frustrated and angry that I am unable to be with Thale due to being imprisoned. The conflict Arild faces is the struggle to balance his love for Thale and his duty to return to prison as promised.</strong></p><p></p><p>2. Why do you think King Erik agreed to the request?</p><p></p><p><strong>King Erik may have agreed to the request because he values the friendship between him and Arild and wants to show mercy and compassion towards Arild. He may also have seen the request as an opportunity to demonstrate his generosity and kindness.</strong></p><p></p><p>3. Do you think Arild was a true friend to King Erik?</p><p></p><p><strong>Arild demonstrated his loyalty and respect towards King Erik by asking for his permission and keeping his promise to return to prison after planting and harvesting a crop. This shows that Arild values the friendship between them and is willing to abide by the rules set by King Erik. Therefore, I believe Arild was a true friend to King Erik.</strong></p><p></p><p>4. Why do you think the author starts the story with the letter that you read along with Arild?</p><p></p><p><strong>The author may have started the story with the letter that the reader reads along with Arild to immediately introduce the conflict and emotions involved in the story. The letter also serves as a catalyst for Arild's actions and decisions throughout the story. By starting with the letter, the author also allows the reader to empathize with Arild and understand his motivations and feelings.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
