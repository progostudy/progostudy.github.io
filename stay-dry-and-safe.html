On their way home, a fisherman said, “We have gone near the water and some bathe in it. I hope nobody is drowned." Let us count, said another. There were twelve of us this morning. They all counted each man but forgot to count himself. So each counted eleven. Someone is surely drowned, they said. Which of us is it? Then they asked a stranger passing by to help them in their trouble. He laughed and said, I'll count you. He tapped the nearest man on the shoulder with his cane and said, One! Then he tapped the next man and said, Two! Then he went on tapping them until he had counted twelve. God bless you! the fisherman said together. Thank you, you have found out that we are all safe. 16. What is the setting of the story? 17. How many fisherman went fishing? 18. Why did they count eleven? 19. How many are drowned? 20.
