She doesn't have a hometown, and she won't ever have life-long friends. She has never been in one place The fist thing that strikes you about Katherine is her smile. It is by no means a perfect smile it isn't even close. It's how easily that smile comes that makes it so special. A glance from a nearby stranger will earn a broad smile. A smile will get a heartfelt grin, and agrin receives such laughing smiles that most people turn around after they've past and shake their heads with concem. This is a story about saying goodbye and then turning around and saying hello. It's about moving it's about change. It's about daily life in the Air Force. Each move means another house and different friends. Different rules and different cultures A simple smile helps Katherine through this change. Her joy is seeing others feel joy. Her happiness is helping others know happiness. She is dependent. Without others, her life would be hollow. Empty Who is Katherine Wamer? She is a self-confident, yet shy little girl whose father is in the Air Force She's moved so many times before that this should be routine, but each time it gets harder and harder. She just can't say goodbye anymore. She doesn't want to go, but it is a warm, summer morning, but everyone inside the brick house is feeling cold. The children are aroused and teeth are brushed. Sleeping bags are rolled and stuffed in the car. Nothing remains except a few memories. Mom and Dad help the children into the car and get them buckled. They then climb into their own seats and say "Well adjust." But everyone's eyes are wet. "Why Alabama?" "What could be in Alabama? But there's no going back. The orders came. We move. Neighbors wave goodbye and friends turn away to hide their tears. Katherine presses her nose against the car window and watches the people slowly falling away behind. Suddenly her best trend Katie breaks into a run and starts chasing the car. She waves and laughs, but the tears still fall. Katherine doesn't notice the tears. She smiles and waves, and realizes that her parents were right. She​</a>

A Tale of Two CitiesBy: Charles Dickens      There was a steaming mist in all the   hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding   none. A Clammy and intensely cold mist,  it slow way through the air in ripples that   visibly   followed   and   overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It  was  dense enough to shut   out   everything from the  light  of  the   coach-lamps   but these its own workings, and a few yards of  road: and  wreck  of  the   laboring  houses  steamed  into  it, as  if they had made it all.A. calmB. guiltyC. forcefulD. mysterious5. Charlotte's Webby: Anonymous     But I feel peaceful. Your success in the rain this morning   was to a small degree, my success. Your future is assured. You will live, secure and safe, Wilbur. Nothing can harm   you now. This autumn days will shorten and grow cold. The leaves will shake loose from the trees and fall. Christmas will come and the snows of winter. You will live to enjoy the beauty of the frozen world, for humane a great deal to Zuckerman and he will not harm you, ever. Winter will pass, the days will lengthen, and the ice will melt in the pasture pond. The song sparrow will return and sing, the frogs will awake, and the warm wind will blow again. All these sights and sounds and smells will be yours to enjoy, Wilbur. This lovely world, these precious days.A. happinessB. acceptanceC. mysteriousD. proud​</a>

She doesn't have a hometown, and she won't ever have life-long friends. She has never been in one place The fist thing that strikes you about Katherine is her smile. It is by no means a perfect smile it isn't even close. It's how easily that smile comes that makes it so special. A glance from a nearby stranger will earn a broad smile.
