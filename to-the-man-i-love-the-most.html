I will love you as a battlefield loves young men and as peppermints love your allergies, and I will love you as the banana peel loves the shoe of a man who was just struck by a shingle falling off a house. I will love you as a volunteer fire department loves rushing into burning buildings and as burning buildings love to chase them back out, and as a parachute loves to leave a blimp and as a blimp operator loves to chase after it.I will love you as a dagger loves a certain person’s back, and as a certain person loves to wear dagger proof tunics, and as a dagger proof tunic loves to go to a certain dry cleaning facility, and how a certain employee of a dry cleaning facility loves to stay up late with a pair of binoculars, watching a dagger factory for hours in the hopes of catching a burglar, and as a burglar loves sneaking up behind people with binoculars, suddenly realizing that she has left her dagger at home. I will love you as a drawer loves a secret compartment, and as a secret compartment loves a secret, and as a secret loves to make a person gasp, and as a gasping person loves a glass of brandy to calm their nerves, and as a glass of brandy loves to shatter on the floor, and as the noise of glass shattering loves to make someone else gasp, and as someone else gasping loves a nearby desk to lean against, even if leaning against it presses a lever that loves to open a drawer and reveal a secret compartment. I will love you until all such compartments are discovered and opened, and until all the secrets have gone gasping into the world. I will love you until all the codes and hearts have been broken and until every anagram and egg has been unscrambled.I will love you until every fire is extinguised and until every home is rebuilt from the handsomest and most susceptible of woods, and until every criminal is handcuffed by the laziest of policemen. I will love until M. hates snakes and J. hates grammar, and I will love you until C. realizes S. is not worthy of his love and N. realizes he is not worthy of the V. I will love you until the bird hates a nest and the worm hates an apple, and until the apple hates a tree and the tree hates a nest, and until a bird hates a tree and an apple hates a nest, although honestly I cannot imagine that last occurrence no matter how hard I try. I will love you as we grow older, which has just happened, and has happened again, and happened several days ago, continuously, and then several years before that, and will continue to happen as the spinning hands of every clock and the flipping pages of every calendar mark the passage of time, except for the clocks that people have forgotten to wind and the calendars that people have forgotten to place in a highly visible area. I will love you as we find ourselves farther and farther from one another, where we once we were so close that we could slip the curved straw, and the long, slender spoon, between our lips and fingers respectively.I will love you until the chances of us running into one another slip from slim to zero, and until your face is fogged by distant memory, and your memory faced by distant fog, and your fog memorized by a distant face, and your distance distanced by the memorized memory of a foggy fog. I will love you no matter where you go and who you see, no matter where you avoid and who you don’t see, and no matter who sees you avoiding where you go. I will love you no matter what happens to you, and no matter how I discover what happens to you, and no matter what happens to me as I discover this, and now matter how I am discovered after what happens to me as I am discovering this.Where is this from?​</a>

                                            Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2.

                                            Box Full of Kisses Some time ago, a man punished his 3-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, "This is for you, Daddy." The man became embarrassed by his over-reaction earlier, but his rage continued when he saw that the box was empty. He yelled at her, "Don't you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried "Oh, Daddy, it's not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They're all for you, Daddy." The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness Only a short time later, an accident took the life of the child. Her father kept the gold box by his bed for many years and, whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there (https wealthygon llaco 10-most-inspirational-short-sorus) Moral of the story: Love is the most precious gift in the world.

If so, define the gender of the persona by selecting a specific stanza that supports your understanding of the character's sexuality? Poem: When The House is EmptyNo one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing. At other times it feels like being mildly drunk, or confused. There is a sort of invisible blanket between the world and me. I find it hard to take in what anyone says. Or perhaps, hard to want to take it in. It is so uninteresting. Yet, I want others to be about me. I dread the moment when the house is empty. If only they would talk to me. There are moments, most unexpected, when something inside me tries to assure me that I* don’t really mind so much, not so very much, after all. Love is not the whole of a man’s life. I was happy before I ever met H. I’ve plenty of what are called resources…. One is ashamed to listen to this voice but it seems for a little to be making out a good case. Then comes a sudden jab of red-hot memory and all this “common sense” vanishes like an ant in the mouth of a furnace… And no one told me about the laziness of grief. Not only writing but even reading a letter is too much. Even shaving. What does it matter now whether my cheek is rough or smooth? They say an unhappy man wants distraction on a cold night, he’d rather lie there shivering than get up and find one.​</a>

I will love you as a volunteer fire department loves rushing into burning buildings and as burning buildings love to chase them back out, and as a parachute loves to leave a blimp and as a blimp operator loves to chase after it.I will love you as a dagger loves a certain person’s back, and as a certain person loves to wear dagger proof tunics, and as a dagger proof tunic loves to go to a certain dry cleaning facility, and how a certain employee of a dry cleaning facility loves to stay up late with a pair of binoculars, watching a dagger factory for hours in the hopes of catching a burglar, and as a burglar loves sneaking up behind people with binoculars, suddenly realizing that she has left her dagger at home.

I will love you until all the codes and hearts have been broken and until every anagram and egg has been unscrambled.I will love you until every fire is extinguised and until every home is rebuilt from the handsomest and most susceptible of woods, and until every criminal is handcuffed by the laziest of policemen. I will love until M. hates snakes and J. hates grammar, and I will love you until C. realizes S. is not worthy of his love and N. realizes he is not worthy of the V. I will love you until the bird hates a nest and the worm hates an apple, and until the apple hates a tree and the tree hates a nest, and until a bird hates a tree and an apple hates a nest, although honestly I cannot imagine that last occurrence no matter how hard I try. I will love you as we grow older, which has just happened, and has happened again, and happened several days ago, continuously, and then several years before that, and will continue to happen as the spinning hands of every clock and the flipping pages of every calendar mark the passage of time, except for the clocks that people have forgotten to wind and the calendars that people have forgotten to place in a highly visible area. I will love you as we find ourselves farther and farther from one another, where we once we were so close that we could slip the curved straw, and the long, slender spoon, between our lips and fingers respectively.I will love you until the chances of us running into one another slip from slim to zero, and until your face is fogged by distant memory, and your memory faced by distant fog, and your fog memorized by a distant face, and your distance distanced by the memorized memory of a foggy fog. I will love you no matter where you go and who you see, no matter where you avoid and who you don’t see, and no matter who sees you avoiding where you go. I will love you no matter what happens to you, and no matter how I discover what happens to you, and no matter what happens to me as I discover this, and now matter how I am discovered after what happens to me as I am discovering this.Where is this from?​</h2><br />

                            11. Love Is All We NeedThe world will be a better place if there is love. V.B. Feliciano said "Love is the most powerful thing in the world. It can change you, your world, and your life." Love can make you the happiest person and it teaches you how to be someone. Love is the least understood part of human life. Some people think that love is complicated because it breaks your heart. However, I believe that love is all we need because it encourages us to be the greatest, it makes our life better, and it teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic.I can relate the quote to a movie entitled "A Walk to Remember" where the power of love prevailed between Landon and Jaime. From a bad boy in high school, Landon became a good man for Jaime even if it meant he have to leave his friends. Jaime's love taught Landon so many things by granting some of Jaime's wishes. Even if he knew that Jaime will be gone due to sickness, he cared and loved her all through out.I personally believe in the power of love for so many reasons. First of all, love encourages us to be the greatest. People are influenced by the person they spend the most time with. Being with their loved ones makes them feel special. Because of this, it inspires and motivates them to be the best they can be. Secondly. love makes our life better. It adds color to our life. It makes us the happiest person on earth, Finally, love teaches us to be stronger and more optimistic. Love gives you hope when you're down. It gives you light when all you can see is darkness.In conclusion, love is we need because it gives your life a meaning. It teaches you a lot of lessons that can help you in your life. Love can change you and your life to a better one. Sometimes, it may seem complicated but always remember that giving up is not an option. Love gives you a positive attitude and it makes you the best version of yourself. You could always give without loving, but you can never love without giving.Question :1. what does the thesis statement of the author? 2.

                            12. Box Full of Kisses Some time ago, a man punished his 3-year-old daughter for wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became infuriated when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, "This is for you, Daddy." The man became embarrassed by his over-reaction earlier, but his rage continued when he saw that the box was empty. He yelled at her, "Don't you know, when you give someone a present, there is supposed to be something inside The little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and cried "Oh, Daddy, it's not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They're all for you, Daddy." The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her forgiveness Only a short time later, an accident took the life of the child. Her father kept the gold box by his bed for many years and, whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there (https wealthygon llaco 10-most-inspirational-short-sorus) Moral of the story: Love is the most precious gift in the world.

                            28. Can you identify the character of the poem? If so, define the gender of the persona by selecting a specific stanza that supports your understanding of the character's sexuality? Poem: When The House is EmptyNo one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing. At other times it feels like being mildly drunk, or confused. There is a sort of invisible blanket between the world and me. I find it hard to take in what anyone says. Or perhaps, hard to want to take it in. It is so uninteresting. Yet, I want others to be about me. I dread the moment when the house is empty. If only they would talk to me. There are moments, most unexpected, when something inside me tries to assure me that I* don’t really mind so much, not so very much, after all. Love is not the whole of a man’s life. I was happy before I ever met H. I’ve plenty of what are called resources…. One is ashamed to listen to this voice but it seems for a little to be making out a good case. Then comes a sudden jab of red-hot memory and all this “common sense” vanishes like an ant in the mouth of a furnace… And no one told me about the laziness of grief. Not only writing but even reading a letter is too much. Even shaving. What does it matter now whether my cheek is rough or smooth? They say an unhappy man wants distraction on a cold night, he’d rather lie there shivering than get up and find one.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Based on the given stanza, there is no definitive indication of the persona's gender or sexuality. The poem does not provide any explicit or implicit references to the gender or sexuality of the character. The persona appears to be experiencing grief and feelings of loneliness and isolation in an empty house. The focus of the poem is on the character's emotional state and the various sensations and thoughts that they are experiencing as a result of their grief. Therefore, it is not appropriate to define the gender of the persona based on the given stanza.</p><br />
