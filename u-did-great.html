I have heard of a dog who did not leave its master even when the master died. According to scientists, dogs have evolved to be loval to humans. They also help deter criminals, like thieves. When dogs bark, criminals become afraid. Dogs growi u popie they think are a threat. They also ireip boost peopie's moods because they re fnendly and playful. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a erson's health. According to them dogs reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease nd they help prevent allergies, asthma, and eczema in children! You might think at I am not responsible enough to have a pei dog. But, i have demonstrated sponsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every ernoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning after it. Getting a pet dog would be good for our whole family! Love, Natalie​</a>

                        <p><strong>1. Luke records that Jesus was praying when Heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him. Luke clarifies that the spirit descended in the "bodily form" of a dove, as opposed to merely "descending like" a dove. In Acts 10:37–38, the ministry of Jesus is described as following "the baptism which John preached".</strong></p><p><strong>2. The Gospel is neither abstract nor neutral. Where there is poverty, misery or oppression, there is also Word of Liberation. As that day in Nazareth synagogue: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor; He has sent me to proclaim liberty for captives and sight for the blind, to let the oppressed go free, and to proclaim the Lord’s year of grace. (Lk 4, 18-19). What was announced by Isaiah prophet is fulfilled (Is 61, 1 -2). Jesus´ message presents, this expected sign: The poor have the good news proclaimed to them (Mt 11, 5).</strong></p><p><strong>3. The Old Testament tells of God's love manifested in his mercy. This was first manifested in freeing his people from their slavery in Egypt. ... Even though God sent his people into exile, he did not make an end of them or forsake them, "for you are a gracious and merciful God" (Neh 9:31).</strong></p><p><strong>4. By giving up his Earthly life on the cross at Calvary, Jesus showed the ultimate love, not only for Christians but for all of mankind. Through his sacrifice, he provided us all with deliverance and a pathway to spend eternity with God.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Another very popular form of the devotion is the Chaplet of the Divine Mercy. The primary focus of the Divine Mercy devotion is the merciful love of God and the desire to let that love and mercy flow through one's own heart towards those in need of it.</strong></p><br />

I have heard of a dog who did not leave its master even when the master died. According to scientists, dogs have evolved to be loval to humans. They also help deter criminals, like thieves. When dogs bark, criminals become afraid. Dogs growi u popie they think are a threat. They also ireip boost peopie's moods because they re fnendly and playful. Doctors have even found that owning a dog can improve a erson's health. According to them dogs reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease nd they help prevent allergies, asthma, and eczema in children! You might think at I am not responsible enough to have a pei dog. But, i have demonstrated sponsibility by making my bed every morning and doing my homework every ernoon. I know that I would be responsible for walking our pet dog and cleaning after it. Getting a pet dog would be good for our whole family! Love, Natalie​</h2><br />
