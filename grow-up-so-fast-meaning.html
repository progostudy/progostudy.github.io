                                            Read carefully the excerpt from the story “The Happy Mirror”. The do the activities that follow.
Many years ago, there was a small family in Japan. There lived a father, mother
and their little daughter. They took their daughter to the temple when she was only
thirty days old wearing a long kimono like all Japanese babies do. The parents gave
the baby a set of beautiful dolls on her first doll festival, and when their daughter turned
three, she was no longer a baby but a little girl fast growing up. She was loved by her
parents very much. One day, a messenger came and brought news that the father is
needed by the Emperor to Tokyo. They haven’t had a horse so the father will need to
walk the long way. The mother and the little daughter bid farewell to the father and
promised him that they will take care of each other and will wait for him. After many
days, the father came back and brought the mother and daughter presents. The little
girl received a doll and she was very glad while the mother was amazed by the present.
It was a thing which she saw a beautiful face of a woman. The husband laughed and
told her it was a mirror and she only saw her own reflection. He told her that if she
brings a smile to the mirror, she will see a smiling face and if she didn’t it will reflect
the mirror. The wife thanked her husband and promised that she will always bring a
smiling face to the mirror. She often looked at the mirror and does what she had
promised. She would always see a happy face in it. Many years passed and she grew
tired of looking at it. She decided to give the precious gift to her daughter who grew
into a woman exactly like her mother. One day, she called the daughter and gave a
beautiful box, and the daughter was surprised of what she saw. It was the image of
her mother inside the round shiny thing. It was the image of her mother she used to
look at when she was a little girl. The mother told her to smile every time she will look
at her inside the mirror and assured her that she will smile back. For that day on, the
daughter kept the box near her. Once each year, she opened it and proved that her
mother’s words was always true. Always she saw her mother’s smiling face when she
smiles at her. The daughter always remembers to bring smiles to the thing inside the
little box, and always the smiles come back at her.

                                            I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

                            4. Read carefully the excerpt from the story “The Happy Mirror”. The do the activities that follow.
Many years ago, there was a small family in Japan. There lived a father, mother
and their little daughter. They took their daughter to the temple when she was only
thirty days old wearing a long kimono like all Japanese babies do. The parents gave
the baby a set of beautiful dolls on her first doll festival, and when their daughter turned
three, she was no longer a baby but a little girl fast growing up. She was loved by her
parents very much. One day, a messenger came and brought news that the father is
needed by the Emperor to Tokyo. They haven’t had a horse so the father will need to
walk the long way. The mother and the little daughter bid farewell to the father and
promised him that they will take care of each other and will wait for him. After many
days, the father came back and brought the mother and daughter presents. The little
girl received a doll and she was very glad while the mother was amazed by the present.
It was a thing which she saw a beautiful face of a woman. The husband laughed and
told her it was a mirror and she only saw her own reflection. He told her that if she
brings a smile to the mirror, she will see a smiling face and if she didn’t it will reflect
the mirror. The wife thanked her husband and promised that she will always bring a
smiling face to the mirror. She often looked at the mirror and does what she had
promised. She would always see a happy face in it. Many years passed and she grew
tired of looking at it. She decided to give the precious gift to her daughter who grew
into a woman exactly like her mother. One day, she called the daughter and gave a
beautiful box, and the daughter was surprised of what she saw. It was the image of
her mother inside the round shiny thing. It was the image of her mother she used to
look at when she was a little girl. The mother told her to smile every time she will look
at her inside the mirror and assured her that she will smile back. For that day on, the
daughter kept the box near her. Once each year, she opened it and proved that her
mother’s words was always true. Always she saw her mother’s smiling face when she
smiles at her. The daughter always remembers to bring smiles to the thing inside the
little box, and always the smiles come back at her.

                            8. I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book.

Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010).

Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.
