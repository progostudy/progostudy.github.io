There are reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places.
For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life,
you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro
houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs (Barrot, 2016, p.78).

There are reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places.
For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life,
you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro
houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs (Barrot, 2016, p.78).
