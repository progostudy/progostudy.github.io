                                            Ok, so i'm a lesbian and i've gotten myself a girlfriend in about a month ago.But something doesn't feel normal to me,it has always been like this since i realized i like girls, it was the feeling i always feel when my classmates/friends tell me "Hey, this girl has a crush on you bla bla bla" I always say i also like them back.Even though in reality, I never really talked to them in my school Life like everytime i think or believe that a girl likes me i just make myself think i like them back, the same thing happened to when i found out my girlfriend liked me so i said i like her too, even though i didn't really know her well. And when we finally started dating i kind of wanted to end it already because i always keep thinking that every other girl is prettier than her and that i don't really like her, but even if i wanted to break up with her, i do know that she self harms(cuts herself) and i don't want to make it worse so i keep holding myself back from breaking up with her, but then again i'm not happy with our relationship. Do i actually like her or am I just clinging to affection she gives?What do I do?Do i break up with her?

                                            alin din ang introduction Instruction: Watch the movie 200 Pounds Beauty (2006) Afterwards, answer the following questions: 1. Describe the physical self of the main character (1) at the beginning of the movie, and at the of the movie. The main character Kang Han-na is an extremely overweight woman that is a ghost singer for a popular singer and a phone sex operator. She has a wonderful voice but not attractive enough to be considered. The main character physical appearance changed because she did a plastic surgery that is most of korean's ways to improve their self confidence and to be considered as a person. Han na did a head to toe plastic surgery, her eyes were steady to attractive eyes, nose from a huge to pointed one, lips were not different much, but her face totally changed her facial shape from rounded to oval. The body changed a lot because it really is the main reason of everyone to lose their confidence, her body went from obese and plump to petite, a dainty gorgeous woman although she really was beautiful when she was her true self. 2. What is the climax of the story? How does this turning point appeal to you? The climax of the story is when the overweight woman emerges pretty and slender. The main character decided to use South Korea's tool to boost a confidence and to be "accepted" by people that is plastic surgery. She chose to make herself different from before for the sake of her "crush" or the man she wanted so badly and also to be recognize. This story appeal to me in various ways, one is when she was down because some of her so called friends literally shows no support or even made her feel down, I somehow experience that situation and it really is diminishing in self confidence. Also the climax affects me when she finally boost her confidence when everyone started to compliment and admire her beauty, myself somehow relate in that situation, I am the kind of person who doesn't like to be complimented all the time but once someone does it genuinely makes me happy which helps me to gain and improve my self image. ff. Based on the entire narrative and on the ending, what kind of beauty is prescribed or supported by the film? Explain your answer. In my opinion, the movie prescribes an exotic kind of beauty because it tackles the body composition and the facial features itself, It describes how one based on the physical appearance and not on the personality, most people nowadays are like this, they admire a person just by their looks which is totally normal and fine but it is more admirable when someone looks deeper into the person's character. The lesson I've learned from this movie is simply plastic surgery is a truely a choice but it is different on why you would do it is it because it helps yourself to be more confident and build up your self worth or because of social pressure. Loving who you truely are plays a big factor on accepting your flaws and once you did everything falls in to the right places.​</a>

                                            Summarize the Story in 5-10 sentencesTHE HEROISM OF BERNARDO CARPIOOnce upon a time, there was a couple who lived in one of the many mountains of San Mateo, Rizal. The man and the woman were very poor and led a very hard life. But one day, amidst all their poverty and hardships, came a bundle of joy and happiness. The man and the woman were given the gift of the birth of a big, beautiful, and healthy baby boy. They named their newborn son Bernardo Carpio and he became his parents’ most precious treasure.Like any other kid, Bernardo loved to play. But something was noticeably very different about Bernardo. Unlike the other kids, Bernardo had the power of extraordinary strength.It was said that when Bernardo was still a baby crawling on all fours, all the floorboard nails that he hooked with his tiny fingernails were pulled out from their very places. When Bernardo was still learning how to walk, any railing that he used for support was destroyed and splintered into pieces. And anytime Bernardo’s parents gave him a new toy to play with, the toy would break and become crushed in the palms of his small hands.As Bernardo grew up to be a handsome young man, his power doubled and increased even more. He soon became renowned not only for his power of extraordinary strength, but also for his dashing good looks. Furthermore, Bernardo possessed great courage and bravery that were second to none. Everyone knew that Bernardo could easily beat any man so no one would dare face Bernardo Carpio in a match of strength and bravery.Not like other typical guys, Bernardo was not interested in merriment, social gatherings, and other festivities. The loveliness of all the beautiful young women in his town did not appeal to him. What really captivated Bernardo was the forest.Bernardo found his real happiness in the forest. The part where the trees were the thickest and the densest is where he often stayed. There is where he spent time with and sought the company of his close friends, the animals of the forest.In the forest that Bernardo frequented lived an enchanted creature. This enchanted creature was a very big and a very strong male. However, the creature also had the ugly manner of envying and causing harm to others. The enchanted creature had seen Bernardo many times during the innumerable visits that he had made to the forest.It did not take long before the begrudging and hateful enchanted creature got wind of Bernardo’s fame for his extraordinary strength. The enchanted creature was sure that the young man would be no match against his own power and strength. One day, the enchanted creature waited for Bernardo to come into the forest. As soon as he saw Bernardo, he immediately challenged him to a duel. Bernardo was not one to back down from any fight so he accepted the challenge right away.And so the two fought. This was followed by many different battles in which both of them made use of their power of great strength. And in every single one of them, the enchanted creature lost.They separated after a long and arduous battle. The enchanted creature left but not without hatred in his heart for the one that defeated him. He waited for the right time and the right opportunity to exact revenge on Bernardo for the loss and shame that he had suffered in his hands.When the enchanted creature was able to chance upon Bernardo once again, he invited him to a hidden area of the forest. In that area were two enormous slabs of stone that were positioned on either side of the place. In the middle of those two stone slabs was where the enchanted creature dwelled. The creature told Bernardo to go ahead and enter the place. As soon as Bernardo reached the spot right in the center of the two stones, the enchanted creature vanished into thin air. And suddenly, the two stone slabs started to fall towards Bernardo. Using his extraordinary strength, Bernardo fought against the stones’ massive weight and size to prevent them from crushing him.According to the elders, Bernardo Carpio is still in the same place, holding those two stones. And every time an earthquake occurs, it is said that it is because of Bernardo Carpio moving and wishing to break free.I'm very sorry that this is Long</a>

                                            6 NON- SEXUAL ADVICE FOR YOUNGSTERS
Do not spend so much time trying to be more physically attractive in order to just impress your crush rather than making yourself mentally attractive.
Educate yourself , address your reccuring toxic thoughts , deal with your insecurities and learn to be happy on your own.
That's attractive.
Normalize saying "No" without needing to over explain yourself. 
If someone is offended by your boundaries , that's their problem.
The best weight you'll ever lose is the weight of other people's opinion of you.
Don't subscribe to other people's definition of "FUN".
Fun doesn't have to mean drinking , partying and socialising.
Fun can be a night in alone , getting lost in a book , a deep conversation , a walk, creating art , playing music , or doing your work. 
FUN IS YOURS ; YOU DEFINE IT.
Before you get married 
discuss bills , parenting styles , credit , debt , how to deal with family , what belief will be installed in your children , childhood traumas , sexual expectations , partner expectations , financial expectations , family health history , bucket list , dream home , career and education , political view and whatever else come in mind. 
LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH.
The age of 15-30 is golden era of your life. 
You make friends , lose them too.
You fall , you fail , you learn , you realise , you hit reality , you fall in love , you get hurt too. You lose yourself and eventually become stronger. 
Remember!
These are the best years of your life.
You should understand the difference between enjoying it and ruining it. 
Heal before having children so your children don't have to heal from having you as a parent.</a>

And when we finally started dating i kind of wanted to end it already because i always keep thinking that every other girl is prettier than her and that i don't really like her, but even if i wanted to break up with her, i do know that she self harms(cuts herself) and i don't want to make it worse so i keep holding myself back from breaking up with her, but then again i'm not happy with our relationship. Do i actually like her or am I just clinging to affection she gives?What do I do?Do i break up with her?

                            7. alin din ang introduction Instruction: Watch the movie 200 Pounds Beauty (2006) Afterwards, answer the following questions: 1. Describe the physical self of the main character (1) at the beginning of the movie, and at the of the movie. The main character Kang Han-na is an extremely overweight woman that is a ghost singer for a popular singer and a phone sex operator. She has a wonderful voice but not attractive enough to be considered. The main character physical appearance changed because she did a plastic surgery that is most of korean's ways to improve their self confidence and to be considered as a person. Han na did a head to toe plastic surgery, her eyes were steady to attractive eyes, nose from a huge to pointed one, lips were not different much, but her face totally changed her facial shape from rounded to oval. The body changed a lot because it really is the main reason of everyone to lose their confidence, her body went from obese and plump to petite, a dainty gorgeous woman although she really was beautiful when she was her true self. 2. What is the climax of the story? How does this turning point appeal to you? The climax of the story is when the overweight woman emerges pretty and slender. The main character decided to use South Korea's tool to boost a confidence and to be "accepted" by people that is plastic surgery. She chose to make herself different from before for the sake of her "crush" or the man she wanted so badly and also to be recognize. This story appeal to me in various ways, one is when she was down because some of her so called friends literally shows no support or even made her feel down, I somehow experience that situation and it really is diminishing in self confidence. Also the climax affects me when she finally boost her confidence when everyone started to compliment and admire her beauty, myself somehow relate in that situation, I am the kind of person who doesn't like to be complimented all the time but once someone does it genuinely makes me happy which helps me to gain and improve my self image. ff. Based on the entire narrative and on the ending, what kind of beauty is prescribed or supported by the film? Explain your answer. In my opinion, the movie prescribes an exotic kind of beauty because it tackles the body composition and the facial features itself, It describes how one based on the physical appearance and not on the personality, most people nowadays are like this, they admire a person just by their looks which is totally normal and fine but it is more admirable when someone looks deeper into the person's character. The lesson I've learned from this movie is simply plastic surgery is a truely a choice but it is different on why you would do it is it because it helps yourself to be more confident and build up your self worth or because of social pressure. Loving who you truely are plays a big factor on accepting your flaws and once you did everything falls in to the right places.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Thank you for the summary of the movie "200 Pounds Beauty". Based on the narrative and ending of the movie, the kind of beauty that is prescribed or supported by the film is physical beauty. The movie portrays physical beauty as a means of gaining acceptance and success in society, as the main character's transformation leads to her achieving her dreams and winning the affection of her crush. The movie also suggests that plastic surgery is a viable solution for individuals who are not considered physically attractive, as it can provide a way to change one's appearance and gain confidence. However, it is important to note that the movie does not promote or support the idea of using plastic surgery to conform to societal standards of beauty or to meet others' expectations. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of self-love and acceptance, and the need to focus on inner qualities rather than just physical appearance.</p><br />

                            8. Summarize the Story in 5-10 sentencesTHE HEROISM OF BERNARDO CARPIOOnce upon a time, there was a couple who lived in one of the many mountains of San Mateo, Rizal. The man and the woman were very poor and led a very hard life. But one day, amidst all their poverty and hardships, came a bundle of joy and happiness. The man and the woman were given the gift of the birth of a big, beautiful, and healthy baby boy. They named their newborn son Bernardo Carpio and he became his parents’ most precious treasure.Like any other kid, Bernardo loved to play. But something was noticeably very different about Bernardo. Unlike the other kids, Bernardo had the power of extraordinary strength.It was said that when Bernardo was still a baby crawling on all fours, all the floorboard nails that he hooked with his tiny fingernails were pulled out from their very places. When Bernardo was still learning how to walk, any railing that he used for support was destroyed and splintered into pieces. And anytime Bernardo’s parents gave him a new toy to play with, the toy would break and become crushed in the palms of his small hands.As Bernardo grew up to be a handsome young man, his power doubled and increased even more. He soon became renowned not only for his power of extraordinary strength, but also for his dashing good looks. Furthermore, Bernardo possessed great courage and bravery that were second to none. Everyone knew that Bernardo could easily beat any man so no one would dare face Bernardo Carpio in a match of strength and bravery.Not like other typical guys, Bernardo was not interested in merriment, social gatherings, and other festivities. The loveliness of all the beautiful young women in his town did not appeal to him. What really captivated Bernardo was the forest.Bernardo found his real happiness in the forest. The part where the trees were the thickest and the densest is where he often stayed. There is where he spent time with and sought the company of his close friends, the animals of the forest.In the forest that Bernardo frequented lived an enchanted creature. This enchanted creature was a very big and a very strong male. However, the creature also had the ugly manner of envying and causing harm to others. The enchanted creature had seen Bernardo many times during the innumerable visits that he had made to the forest.It did not take long before the begrudging and hateful enchanted creature got wind of Bernardo’s fame for his extraordinary strength. The enchanted creature was sure that the young man would be no match against his own power and strength. One day, the enchanted creature waited for Bernardo to come into the forest. As soon as he saw Bernardo, he immediately challenged him to a duel. Bernardo was not one to back down from any fight so he accepted the challenge right away.And so the two fought. This was followed by many different battles in which both of them made use of their power of great strength. And in every single one of them, the enchanted creature lost.They separated after a long and arduous battle. The enchanted creature left but not without hatred in his heart for the one that defeated him. He waited for the right time and the right opportunity to exact revenge on Bernardo for the loss and shame that he had suffered in his hands.When the enchanted creature was able to chance upon Bernardo once again, he invited him to a hidden area of the forest. In that area were two enormous slabs of stone that were positioned on either side of the place. In the middle of those two stone slabs was where the enchanted creature dwelled. The creature told Bernardo to go ahead and enter the place. As soon as Bernardo reached the spot right in the center of the two stones, the enchanted creature vanished into thin air. And suddenly, the two stone slabs started to fall towards Bernardo. Using his extraordinary strength, Bernardo fought against the stones’ massive weight and size to prevent them from crushing him.According to the elders, Bernardo Carpio is still in the same place, holding those two stones. And every time an earthquake occurs, it is said that it is because of Bernardo Carpio moving and wishing to break free.I'm very sorry that this is Long</h2><br />

                            11. 6 NON- SEXUAL ADVICE FOR YOUNGSTERS
Do not spend so much time trying to be more physically attractive in order to just impress your crush rather than making yourself mentally attractive.
Educate yourself , address your reccuring toxic thoughts , deal with your insecurities and learn to be happy on your own.
That's attractive.
Normalize saying "No" without needing to over explain yourself. 
If someone is offended by your boundaries , that's their problem.
The best weight you'll ever lose is the weight of other people's opinion of you.
Don't subscribe to other people's definition of "FUN".
Fun doesn't have to mean drinking , partying and socialising.
Fun can be a night in alone , getting lost in a book , a deep conversation , a walk, creating art , playing music , or doing your work. 
FUN IS YOURS ; YOU DEFINE IT.
Before you get married 
discuss bills , parenting styles , credit , debt , how to deal with family , what belief will be installed in your children , childhood traumas , sexual expectations , partner expectations , financial expectations , family health history , bucket list , dream home , career and education , political view and whatever else come in mind. 
LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH.
The age of 15-30 is golden era of your life. 
You make friends , lose them too.
You fall , you fail , you learn , you realise , you hit reality , you fall in love , you get hurt too. You lose yourself and eventually become stronger. 
Remember!
These are the best years of your life.
You should understand the difference between enjoying it and ruining it. 
Heal before having children so your children don't have to heal from having you as a parent.</h2><br />
