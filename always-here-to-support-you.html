Greetings from Maldives! It is my second day here, and I hope for a fun adventure! Yesterday we went snorkeling and saw some sea turtles and coral reefs. I never expected the water to be that crystal clear! Too bad I can't bring any corals home. Today, we will go dolphin spotting at Cinnamon Hakurra and do some island hopping. How's your trip going? Can't wait to see you when we get back. I wish you were here. Miss you! We are here tonight to celebrate the achievements of Mr. Mario Angeles, who has been serving our company for the past 20 years. He is a hardworking man who never failed to give a smile as he sees everyone along the halls. He is a father who is never tired of supporting his two daughters’ and son’s dreams and is successful in doing so. Mr. Angeles does not fail to be optimistic if there are problems along the way and would always cheer us up when we need it. Put three large egg yolks and finely grated parmesan cheese into a bowl. Season it with pepper and mix it well with a fork. Leave it on the side. Then, cook pancetta and crushed garlic on a medium frying pan in medium-high heat. Once the oil is rendered, remove the garlic and add cooked spaghetti and toss it over the heat. Remove the pan from the heat and add a splash of pasta water, season it with pepper, and add the egg and cheese mixture made earlier. Toss it well and add more pasta water until it looks glossy. Serve it with more parmesan cheese and cracked pepper. The problem, however, is that in interpreting and understanding literary texts, the use of one literary term or theory to focus on sometimes bring out more questions and clarifications in the text that should be answered. The tendency now is to look for more answers by looking at another theory that will answer these unclear interpretations. Then it also brings more questions, and so on. This paper aims to prove that through the use of different literary theories and various literary terms, the literary text is explored to its full potential without disrespecting the text itself and at the same time it also brings out a better appreciation of the meaning of the text read.​</a>

                                            "Josefina"(By May Shynne J. Torralba)Josefina was different from the rest of the girls in the class. She was with theboys most of the time and she liked to play with things that are usually played byboys. Everyone knew that she was an orphan. She was only ten years old when sheleft home to forget the heartaches brought by the tragic death of her parents. Shethought that it was best to leave home and go on with her life under the roof andguidance of her auntie and uncle.In school, she never showed weakness. Her classmates liked her because shewas courageous and agile. She was not afraid to fight with boys. Her curly hair wasalways tied up to show her neatly shaved undercut.

Upon hearing the silence, Marcelina tookthe opportunity to ask her classmate. "What happened?" she sighed before shebrought the words out of her mouth. Josefina looked at her and responded clearly."I am scared. I overheard that my auntie and uncle are giving me away because theycould not afford the provision needed to raise me. I don't want to but I was left withno choice. I don't know how other people would treat and accept me. They mightonly laughed and mocked at me because I am different." Marcelina felt herclassmate's honest confession. Then, she comforted her. "You think so much ofthings that has not yet happened. Is it really a sarcastic mouth that scares you orthat small voice inside you? You just need to be you... that is all. No matter whathappens remember that we are always here to comfort you and boost you up." Shepatted her shoulder and smirked to uplift her.

                                            How does these stories illustrate the element of trust found in faith? Some English botanists once visited Switzerland to collect rare mountain flowers. Looking over a cliff they saw some rare plants about twenty feet (six meters) below. The botanists turned to a young boy who had been watching them and said, "Boy, let us tie a rope around your waist and lower you to the ledge below. After digging up two plants, we will pull you up again. We will pay you for your trouble." The boy answered, "I will do it." However, he ran down the mountain to the valley below. Soon he returned with a man. "Sirs," he stated, "this is my father. If you will let him hold the rope, I will go down and get the plants for you." When Dr. John Paton was translating the New Testament into the language of the South Sea Islanders, he could not find a native word for "faith." One day as he was working in his study, one of the natives came in, hot and tired from a long, strenuous walk. As he dropped into a chair, he used a native word meaning, "I am resting my full weight here." Instantly, Dr. Paton grasped this word as the one he needed for "faith." To "rest my full weight" upon something is to fully believe and trust - to have faith - that it will support me. Now as we can observe in the Scripture, it does not always speak of faith in God and His Word in the​</a>

Remember to bundle up with thick socks and snow boots, a coat, a hat and very warm gloves. There are so many fun ways to exercise in the snow start a snowball fight, go sledding, go skating, or build a snow fort! Have fun but always remember these important safety tips: Don't skate on thin ice or deep ponds, be careful not to mix snow with ice when packing snowballs, and make sure your snow fort is sturdy before adding the root. Now get out and play before the snow melts and warm weather is here again! MAIN IDEA: SUPPORTING DETAIL:DETAIL:​</a>

The Most Fascinating Place I Have Ever Been ToPuerto Princesa City in Palawan is the most fascinating place I have ever been to. If I could, I would like to visit it more often. I would love to go back there with my friends and family. Here are the reasons why I think Puerto Princesa in Palawan is the most fascinating place in the world. First, the city is very clean. One would not see garbage scattered in the streets like in Metro Manila. Another is that the people of Puerto are friendly and kind. They are always willing to help tourists and they are always smiling. The second reason is food. I love the fresh and exotic food the city offers. Seafood abounds in the place and there are many restaurants that offer “paluto”. You can buy fresh seafood and have them cooked for you. Third, the accommodations—hotels and inns—are also clean, safe, and priced reasonably. Lastly, I love Puerto Princesa for the abundant beauty of nature that surrounds the city. The mountains and hills are green; the sea is blue and green; it has white sandy beaches that are indeed a paradise for foreigners and locals alike.Reasons Why Puerto Princesa Is a Fascinating Place Reason 1: _______________________________________________________________Supporting detail: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Reason 2: _______________________________________________________________Supporting detail: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Reason 3: _______________________________________________________________Supporting detail: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</a>

                                            Explanation: Gun powder revolutionized war and brought down old hierarchies and strategies after the introduction of the gun, war would never be the same. Similarly, the invention of the printing press allowed books and newspapers to reach vast audiences that otherwise had no access to the written word. This revolutionized education and made possible an era of widespread literacy and democratic thought. Example 2 Evolution is a blind giant who rolls a snowball down a hill. The ball is made of flakes-circumstances. They contribute to the mass without knowing it. They adhere without intention, and without foreseeing what is to result. When they see the result, they marvel at the monster ball and wonder how the contriving of it came to be originally thought out and planned. Whereas there was no such planning, there was only a law: the ball once started, all the circumstances that happened to lie in its path would help to build it, in spite of themselves." (Mark Twain, Tales of Wonder) Explanation: Here, Twain uses an analogy to speak about evolution, comparing it to a giant rolling a snowball down the hill-the results are quite unpredictable, but inevitable. In Popular Culture... Example 1 you never know what My mother always said "life is like a box of chocolates you're going to get!" (Forrest Gump) Explanation: Here, Forrest Gump shares a very memorable analogy, beginning with the simile "life was like a box of chocolates." But this is an analogy because it gives further support and explanation for the comparison, showing that life has many choices and surprises, just like a box of chocolate. Example 2 People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within. (Quote by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in The Leader's Digest by Jim Clemmer, 2003) Explanation: In this quote, the groundbreaking psychiatrist Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (well-known for her 5 Stages of Grief) gives an analogy about the human condition, saying that people, like stained-glass, work differently in situations of light and dark.​</a>

It delights. It comforts. It thrills. Who doesn't want a warmth of a loving hug? Just like words, hugs speak volumes. They can mean "I miss you," "Bye," "I care," "1 love you." "It's OK," "I forgive," "I'm so proud of you!" In victory celebrations, in trying times, or in hours of bereavement, kiss is not the need of the hour. It is the hug that matters most.. A hug costs nothing. But it is a great gift to give on any occasion. No need to shop for it or bother about size or length or width. All you need is to open your arms wide and wrap the person inside them. And no matter how long or how short your arms are, hugs are always a perfect fit. And what so nice about giving a hug? You can get one in return. A hug goes beyond physical contact. It encompasses compassion, love, forgiveness, and care. "A hug delights and warms, and charms that must be why God gave us arms," so goes the quotation. So with arms wide open, why not go out and hug someone today? But first, here's my big, big, hug.

The world is in chaos because of a nuclear war. The Earth is almost completely destroyed because of this war. There are only nine people who survived the war. A med-tech student, a minority leader, a pediatrician, a science teacher, a lawyer, a hunter, a nurse, a botanist, and a pilot. These people are standing on the ground but they cannot stay here for a long time because the ground may collapse anytime soon. The pilot can only save four people because the capacity of his plane is five people only. They will evacuate to a virgin island and could possibly start a new civilization. This island is the only unaffected area during the nuclear war.
The med-tech student is 24 years old, female, a model and she has a microscope. The 46-year old minority leader is male and he has a bible. The pediatrician is a transgender, 27 years old, and the only thing she has is a first aid kit. The science teacher has a science book, and he is already 40 years old. The 60-year old lawyer is female and the only thing that she managed to save during the war is one of her books of the constitution. The hunter is a 30 years old male and he has a gun that he always uses in hunting. The nurse has a Swiss knife, a male and he’s 27 years old. The pregnant botanist is 25 years old, an atheist, and has seeds of herbal plants and vegetables. If you are the pilot, who are the four people that you are to save and join the evacuation to the virgin island? Why? Support your answer.</a>

                                            THE INVENTION OF FOODS 
 have you wondered where all those new foods on the supemarket shelf come from? hundreds of new foods are invented every year, and each one is the result of an invetor at work. potato chips, chewing gum, and peanut butter are three popular foods that were invented here in North America
 Today, potato chips are the biggest selling snack food in canada. The averacanadian eats about4.5 kg of potato chips every year. Sometimes inventions happen by accident. this is how the potato chip was invented about 10 yrs old by a chef named George Crumb. One night a customer at the restaurant asked George to make the potatoes thinner and George cut them as thin as paper and fried them in oil. The costumer loved them and the idea soon caught on, but it wasn't until a potato peeling machine was invented that potato chips could be made in factories and sold all over North America. 
 Imagine a chewing gum made from tree sap. The ealiest chewing gum was invented by the Aboriginal peoples, who used the black spruce tree for a kind of chewy snack, The Aboriginal peoples shared this idea with the pioneers who settled in North America In 1850, John Curtis decided to turn this idea into a chewing gum business. He cooked the gum until it was thick, roolled it out, and cut it into small pieces. they called it "pure spruce gum" It wasn't until 1906 that the first gum as invented. it was called "blibber- blubber". Today there are over a hundred different kinds of bubble gum and new flavours are always being invented. 
 It's hard to believe that four out four out of every five homes in canada has peanut butter in the cupboard. peanut butter was invented by a doctor From St. Louis, U.S.A. in 1890. he wanted to give his patients a high- protein food that was easy to digest. there are eight grams of protein in two tablespoons of peanut butter and also contains some vitamins and minerals. Now there are lots of factories that make peanut butter and this sticky food is the most common sandwich filling in children's lunches. what kind is your favourite, smooth or chunky?
 Our food is always changing thanks to inventors who continue to think up new foods, So go ahead, crunch that potato chips, chews that gum, and spread the peanut butter! Perhaps someday you will create a food of your own.

                                            Learning Task 7. Below is Donald Trump's speech on January 13, 2021 condemning violence onthe US Capitol. Read it intently and critically. Note all the blases and prejudices contained in thepiingbericsideMy follow Americans, I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of thepast week. As I have said, the incursion of the US Capitol struck at the very heart of ourRepublic. It ongered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum. I want tobe very clear, I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence andvandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law,supporting the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation's most sacredtraditions and valuos, Mob violenco goes against everything I believe in and everything ourmovement stands for, No true supporter of mine could over endorse political violence. No truesupporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No truesupporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their follow Americans. If you do any of thesethings, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it and you are attacking ourcountry. We cannot tolerato it.Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, wehave seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs,too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop. Whether you are on the right or onthe left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence, no excuses, noexceptions, America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will bebrought to justiceNow I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of waysto ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country. There has beenreporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here inWashington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US Secret Service on thepotential threats, Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful andpeaceful way. That is your First Amendment Right. But I cannot emphasize that there must beno violence, no law breaking and no vandalism of any kind,Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement. I havedirected federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington,D.C., We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensurethat a transition can occur safely and without incident. Like all of you, I was shocked anddeeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds ofmillions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm,moderation and grace, We will get through this challenge just like we always do.I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech wehave seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel andblacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us tolisten to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to riseabove the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancingthe interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic,rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law.Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and jointogether as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of ourfarnílies, our communities, and our country. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America,dt​</a>

Should homework be mandatory? 
I can almost see many students nodding along with me as I ask this question. 
Younger generations overloaded with home tasks and numerous assignments 
have already raised this issue many times. 
Yet, homework remains mandatory. 
Is it fair or should it be canceled? 
I believe that homework should not be viewed as a mandatory part of education 
for several reasons. 
First, students spend seven hours every single work day at school. That is a huge 
chunk of life, and with homework added on top of these hours, a child is left with 
no time to live his life to the fullest, socialize, or grow in other areas. 
Second, sitting at your desk solving problems does no good to your health. There 
is a great need to go out with friends and socialize. Do other physical activities 
like walking, riding bicycle, or engaging to various sports. Otherwise, they may be 
very smart but surprisingly weak physically. 
Another argument against this position is that homework is not always the best 
way to obtain knowledge quality-wise. Students ten to ask their parents or siblings 
for help whenever facing difficulties. Busy parents spend extra time explaining 
school materials or solving problems themselves aiming to have more time for 
family, not lessons. As a result, the child will have the homework done but that’s 
not really his work. So, the whole idea of dedication time to self-education is lost 
here. 
Finally, knowing that after classes you would still have to work at home makes 
students less concentrated at school. This result in short attention spans and 
difficulty to concentrate on something for too long. 
All in all, homework should rather be an option. Students understanding that 
they are left behind at some subjects will take their time to go over the material 
at home. However, in other cases, they should have time after school for other 
activities.</a>

Greetings from Maldives! It is my second day here, and I hope for a fun adventure! Yesterday we went snorkeling and saw some sea turtles and coral reefs. I never expected the water to be that crystal clear! Too bad I can't bring any corals home. Today, we will go dolphin spotting at Cinnamon Hakurra and do some island hopping. How's your trip going? Can't wait to see you when we get back. I wish you were here. Miss you! We are here tonight to celebrate the achievements of Mr. Mario Angeles, who has been serving our company for the past 20 years. He is a hardworking man who never failed to give a smile as he sees everyone along the halls. He is a father who is never tired of supporting his two daughters’ and son’s dreams and is successful in doing so. Mr. Angeles does not fail to be optimistic if there are problems along the way and would always cheer us up when we need it. Put three large egg yolks and finely grated parmesan cheese into a bowl. Season it with pepper and mix it well with a fork. Leave it on the side. Then, cook pancetta and crushed garlic on a medium frying pan in medium-high heat. Once the oil is rendered, remove the garlic and add cooked spaghetti and toss it over the heat. Remove the pan from the heat and add a splash of pasta water, season it with pepper, and add the egg and cheese mixture made earlier. Toss it well and add more pasta water until it looks glossy. Serve it with more parmesan cheese and cracked pepper. The problem, however, is that in interpreting and understanding literary texts, the use of one literary term or theory to focus on sometimes bring out more questions and clarifications in the text that should be answered. The tendency now is to look for more answers by looking at another theory that will answer these unclear interpretations. Then it also brings more questions, and so on. This paper aims to prove that through the use of different literary theories and various literary terms, the literary text is explored to its full potential without disrespecting the text itself and at the same time it also brings out a better appreciation of the meaning of the text read.​</h2><br />

                            8. "Josefina"(By May Shynne J. Torralba)Josefina was different from the rest of the girls in the class. She was with theboys most of the time and she liked to play with things that are usually played byboys. Everyone knew that she was an orphan. She was only ten years old when sheleft home to forget the heartaches brought by the tragic death of her parents. Shethought that it was best to leave home and go on with her life under the roof andguidance of her auntie and uncle.In school, she never showed weakness. Her classmates liked her because shewas courageous and agile. She was not afraid to fight with boys. Her curly hair wasalways tied up to show her neatly shaved undercut. Though she was a bit different,her classmates gave the same mutual respect towards her. This made Josefinaexpressed herself freely- from the way she dressed up to the way she carried herself.Nobody dare or care talked about her personal feeling. Not until one morning...Marcelina, her classmate, saw Josefina ran outside the gate of the school. Outof curiosity, she followed her. She called for her but Josefina kept on running untilshe was hidden behind the big tamarind tree. She saw Josefina wailing while herright hand was bleeding for punching the trunk of the tree. Reluctantly, Marcelinashowed herself to her with sympathetic look. Without a single word, Marcelina tookher hand and wiped it until it was clean. Upon hearing the silence, Marcelina tookthe opportunity to ask her classmate. "What happened?" she sighed before shebrought the words out of her mouth. Josefina looked at her and responded clearly."I am scared. I overheard that my auntie and uncle are giving me away because theycould not afford the provision needed to raise me. I don't want to but I was left withno choice. I don't know how other people would treat and accept me. They mightonly laughed and mocked at me because I am different." Marcelina felt herclassmate's honest confession. Then, she comforted her. "You think so much ofthings that has not yet happened. Is it really a sarcastic mouth that scares you orthat small voice inside you? You just need to be you... that is all. No matter whathappens remember that we are always here to comfort you and boost you up." Shepatted her shoulder and smirked to uplift her. The conversation made Josefina feltlighter hence, they made their way back to school.Questions1. Who are the characters in the story?2. Where and when did the story happen?3.

                            12. How does these stories illustrate the element of trust found in faith? Some English botanists once visited Switzerland to collect rare mountain flowers. Looking over a cliff they saw some rare plants about twenty feet (six meters) below. The botanists turned to a young boy who had been watching them and said, "Boy, let us tie a rope around your waist and lower you to the ledge below. After digging up two plants, we will pull you up again. We will pay you for your trouble." The boy answered, "I will do it." However, he ran down the mountain to the valley below. Soon he returned with a man. "Sirs," he stated, "this is my father. If you will let him hold the rope, I will go down and get the plants for you." When Dr. John Paton was translating the New Testament into the language of the South Sea Islanders, he could not find a native word for "faith." One day as he was working in his study, one of the natives came in, hot and tired from a long, strenuous walk. As he dropped into a chair, he used a native word meaning, "I am resting my full weight here." Instantly, Dr. Paton grasped this word as the one he needed for "faith." To "rest my full weight" upon something is to fully believe and trust - to have faith - that it will support me. Now as we can observe in the Scripture, it does not always speak of faith in God and His Word in the​</h2><br />

The Most Fascinating Place I Have Ever Been ToPuerto Princesa City in Palawan is the most fascinating place I have ever been to. If I could, I would like to visit it more often. I would love to go back there with my friends and family. Here are the reasons why I think Puerto Princesa in Palawan is the most fascinating place in the world. First, the city is very clean. One would not see garbage scattered in the streets like in Metro Manila. Another is that the people of Puerto are friendly and kind. They are always willing to help tourists and they are always smiling. The second reason is food. I love the fresh and exotic food the city offers. Seafood abounds in the place and there are many restaurants that offer “paluto”. You can buy fresh seafood and have them cooked for you. Third, the accommodations—hotels and inns—are also clean, safe, and priced reasonably. Lastly, I love Puerto Princesa for the abundant beauty of nature that surrounds the city. The mountains and hills are green; the sea is blue and green; it has white sandy beaches that are indeed a paradise for foreigners and locals alike.Reasons Why Puerto Princesa Is a Fascinating Place Reason 1: _______________________________________________________________Supporting detail: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Reason 2: _______________________________________________________________Supporting detail: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Reason 3: _______________________________________________________________Supporting detail: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />

                            16. Explanation: Gun powder revolutionized war and brought down old hierarchies and strategies after the introduction of the gun, war would never be the same. Similarly, the invention of the printing press allowed books and newspapers to reach vast audiences that otherwise had no access to the written word. This revolutionized education and made possible an era of widespread literacy and democratic thought. Example 2 Evolution is a blind giant who rolls a snowball down a hill. The ball is made of flakes-circumstances. They contribute to the mass without knowing it. They adhere without intention, and without foreseeing what is to result. When they see the result, they marvel at the monster ball and wonder how the contriving of it came to be originally thought out and planned. Whereas there was no such planning, there was only a law: the ball once started, all the circumstances that happened to lie in its path would help to build it, in spite of themselves." (Mark Twain, Tales of Wonder) Explanation: Here, Twain uses an analogy to speak about evolution, comparing it to a giant rolling a snowball down the hill-the results are quite unpredictable, but inevitable. In Popular Culture... Example 1 you never know what My mother always said "life is like a box of chocolates you're going to get!" (Forrest Gump) Explanation: Here, Forrest Gump shares a very memorable analogy, beginning with the simile "life was like a box of chocolates." But this is an analogy because it gives further support and explanation for the comparison, showing that life has many choices and surprises, just like a box of chocolate. Example 2 People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within. (Quote by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in The Leader's Digest by Jim Clemmer, 2003) Explanation: In this quote, the groundbreaking psychiatrist Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (well-known for her 5 Stages of Grief) gives an analogy about the human condition, saying that people, like stained-glass, work differently in situations of light and dark.​</h2><br />

                            17. Directions: The election does not contain a topic sentence; hence you need to understand the selection to infer its main idea. What can a hug do? It delights. It comforts. It thrills. Who doesn't want a warmth of a loving hug? Just like words, hugs speak volumes. They can mean "I miss you," "Bye," "I care," "1 love you." "It's OK," "I forgive," "I'm so proud of you!" In victory celebrations, in trying times, or in hours of bereavement, kiss is not the need of the hour. It is the hug that matters most.. A hug costs nothing. But it is a great gift to give on any occasion. No need to shop for it or bother about size or length or width. All you need is to open your arms wide and wrap the person inside them. And no matter how long or how short your arms are, hugs are always a perfect fit. And what so nice about giving a hug? You can get one in return. A hug goes beyond physical contact. It encompasses compassion, love, forgiveness, and care. "A hug delights and warms, and charms that must be why God gave us arms," so goes the quotation. So with arms wide open, why not go out and hug someone today? But first, here's my big, big, hug.

                            19. INSTRUCTION: Analyze the scenario and answer the guide question.
The world is in chaos because of a nuclear war. The Earth is almost completely destroyed because of this war. There are only nine people who survived the war. A med-tech student, a minority leader, a pediatrician, a science teacher, a lawyer, a hunter, a nurse, a botanist, and a pilot. These people are standing on the ground but they cannot stay here for a long time because the ground may collapse anytime soon. The pilot can only save four people because the capacity of his plane is five people only. They will evacuate to a virgin island and could possibly start a new civilization. This island is the only unaffected area during the nuclear war.
The med-tech student is 24 years old, female, a model and she has a microscope. The 46-year old minority leader is male and he has a bible. The pediatrician is a transgender, 27 years old, and the only thing she has is a first aid kit. The science teacher has a science book, and he is already 40 years old. The 60-year old lawyer is female and the only thing that she managed to save during the war is one of her books of the constitution. The hunter is a 30 years old male and he has a gun that he always uses in hunting. The nurse has a Swiss knife, a male and he’s 27 years old. The pregnant botanist is 25 years old, an atheist, and has seeds of herbal plants and vegetables. If you are the pilot, who are the four people that you are to save and join the evacuation to the virgin island? Why? Support your answer.</h2><br />

 have you wondered where all those new foods on the supemarket shelf come from? hundreds of new foods are invented every year, and each one is the result of an invetor at work. potato chips, chewing gum, and peanut butter are three popular foods that were invented here in North America
 Today, potato chips are the biggest selling snack food in canada. The averacanadian eats about4.5 kg of potato chips every year. Sometimes inventions happen by accident. this is how the potato chip was invented about 10 yrs old by a chef named George Crumb. One night a customer at the restaurant asked George to make the potatoes thinner and George cut them as thin as paper and fried them in oil. The costumer loved them and the idea soon caught on, but it wasn't until a potato peeling machine was invented that potato chips could be made in factories and sold all over North America. 
 Imagine a chewing gum made from tree sap. The ealiest chewing gum was invented by the Aboriginal peoples, who used the black spruce tree for a kind of chewy snack, The Aboriginal peoples shared this idea with the pioneers who settled in North America In 1850, John Curtis decided to turn this idea into a chewing gum business. He cooked the gum until it was thick, roolled it out, and cut it into small pieces. they called it "pure spruce gum" It wasn't until 1906 that the first gum as invented. it was called "blibber- blubber". Today there are over a hundred different kinds of bubble gum and new flavours are always being invented. 
 It's hard to believe that four out four out of every five homes in canada has peanut butter in the cupboard. peanut butter was invented by a doctor From St. Louis, U.S.A. in 1890. he wanted to give his patients a high- protein food that was easy to digest. there are eight grams of protein in two tablespoons of peanut butter and also contains some vitamins and minerals. Now there are lots of factories that make peanut butter and this sticky food is the most common sandwich filling in children's lunches. what kind is your favourite, smooth or chunky?
 Our food is always changing thanks to inventors who continue to think up new foods, So go ahead, crunch that potato chips, chews that gum, and spread the peanut butter! Perhaps someday you will create a food of your own.

                            23. Learning Task 7. Below is Donald Trump's speech on January 13, 2021 condemning violence onthe US Capitol. Read it intently and critically. Note all the blases and prejudices contained in thepiingbericsideMy follow Americans, I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of thepast week. As I have said, the incursion of the US Capitol struck at the very heart of ourRepublic. It ongered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum. I want tobe very clear, I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence andvandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement,Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law,supporting the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation's most sacredtraditions and valuos, Mob violenco goes against everything I believe in and everything ourmovement stands for, No true supporter of mine could over endorse political violence. No truesupporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No truesupporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their follow Americans. If you do any of thesethings, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it and you are attacking ourcountry. We cannot tolerato it.Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, wehave seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs,too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop. Whether you are on the right or onthe left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence, no excuses, noexceptions, America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will bebrought to justiceNow I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of waysto ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country. There has beenreporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here inWashington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US Secret Service on thepotential threats, Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful andpeaceful way. That is your First Amendment Right. But I cannot emphasize that there must beno violence, no law breaking and no vandalism of any kind,Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement. I havedirected federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington,D.C., We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensurethat a transition can occur safely and without incident. Like all of you, I was shocked anddeeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds ofmillions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm,moderation and grace, We will get through this challenge just like we always do.I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech wehave seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel andblacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us tolisten to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to riseabove the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancingthe interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic,rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law.Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and jointogether as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of ourfarnílies, our communities, and our country. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America,dt​</h2><br />

Directions: Read the text below. Then, complete the chart which follows

Should homework be mandatory? 
I can almost see many students nodding along with me as I ask this question. 
Younger generations overloaded with home tasks and numerous assignments 
have already raised this issue many times. 
Yet, homework remains mandatory. 
Is it fair or should it be canceled? 
I believe that homework should not be viewed as a mandatory part of education 
for several reasons. 
First, students spend seven hours every single work day at school. That is a huge 
chunk of life, and with homework added on top of these hours, a child is left with 
no time to live his life to the fullest, socialize, or grow in other areas. 
Second, sitting at your desk solving problems does no good to your health. There 
is a great need to go out with friends and socialize. Do other physical activities 
like walking, riding bicycle, or engaging to various sports. Otherwise, they may be 
very smart but surprisingly weak physically. 
Another argument against this position is that homework is not always the best 
way to obtain knowledge quality-wise. Students ten to ask their parents or siblings 
for help whenever facing difficulties. Busy parents spend extra time explaining 
school materials or solving problems themselves aiming to have more time for 
family, not lessons. As a result, the child will have the homework done but that’s 
not really his work. So, the whole idea of dedication time to self-education is lost 
here. 
Finally, knowing that after classes you would still have to work at home makes 
students less concentrated at school. This result in short attention spans and 
difficulty to concentrate on something for too long. 
All in all, homework should rather be an option. Students understanding that 
they are left behind at some subjects will take their time to go over the material 
at home. However, in other cases, they should have time after school for other 
activities.</h2><br />
