How are you going to think, feel, and behave at your worst and at your best? For example, you are watching your favorite teleserye in your favorite channel. Suddenly, there was an interruption. There is no audio and video, resulting to a dead air - meaning no signal. Your initial reaction may be to scream. Then as you become anxious, you are now thinking that you live in a rough location and feel sad, angry, and ashamed. Then you intentionally slam the door. However, if you choose to pause for a while and exercise proper breathing, you may realize that you will be able to watch the replay the following day. As you calm yourself and accept the situation, you can decide to do household chores or homework, which are the best choices you may ever make that night which will give you fulfilment.

Do not organized your thoughts or plan your message ahead of time to make a good impression to the audience. 4. Gesture is the cement that binds together speakers and their audiences. 5. Being thoroughly prepared in a presentation leads to self-confidence, which is a vital ingredient of effective public speaking.6. Finger tapping or chewing gum do not hinder you from delivery a good message to the audience. 7. It is okay to look at your scripts all the time when you feel nervous. 8. When you record your presentation, have your audience sit partially in frame (you should be the main subject of course), so your digital audience can pick up on the nonverbal cues of the in-person audience. 9. If your platform behavior includes mannerisms unrelated to your spoken message, those actions will call attention to themselves and away from your speech. 10.
