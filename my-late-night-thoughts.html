                                            what to do after burnout?It's been weeks since I've done my usual routine of journalling, exercising, doing my hobbies and meditating.School projects friggin sux when you're lonely.I still have the remaining feelings albeit small, I still desire to get better. I feel like I've wasted time staying up late at night and losing myself to the internet. My healthy and hygiene are being compromised and my sense of identity fading.Only now that I've relearned about being alone with your thoughts can do wonders. My sleep still a wreck though. I think it's gonna be the big hindrance to getting better, next to my apathetic unmotivated brain.​</a>

A feeling that I've never known

Phone is quiet, walls are bare
I drink myself to sleep, who cares?
No one even has to know

Way too much whiskey in my blood

Put me in a fragile state

the cemetery just for laughs Right in the middle of the cemetery they were startled by a tap-
tap-tapping noise coming from the misty shadows. Trembling with fear, they found an old
man with a hammer and chiset chipping away at one of the headstones.
O my Goo. Mister one of them said after catching his breath, You scared us halt

Those fools the old man grumbled "They misspelled my name!" question: 1.what did the two men hear from the misty shadow 2.who do you think is the mister in the story?</a>

______1. Jane was on her way home when she spotted an injured bird on a 
 branch of a tree. She took the bird home and fed it. 
_____ 2. “Look, you aren't going anywhere dressed like that. Get yourself back 
 upstairs and put on something with sleeves.” Dad said to me.
_____ 3. Hello! My name is Henry. I have a twin brother Greg. We may look very 
 much alike in appearance but we have very different personalities.
_____ 4. On your way home, you were surprised by what you saw on the 
 ground. You found a five hundred peso bill. But you couldn’t find the
 owner of the money.
_____ 5. I went to a picnic last week with my family. We brought a lot of foods 
 and drinks. It was a bright sunny day and we had so much fun. I 
 wished to have picnic again.
_____ 6. Queenie woke up late one Monday morning. She was fifteen minute
 late. She rushed out of her house and forgot to bring her umbrella. 
 She ran to school in the rain. Her uniform, shoes and school bag were
 all wet.
_____ 7. Edward looked from the sun. He was thinking about the game. They
 could have won. He could have won the game for them. All he needed
 to do was catch the ball, but he didn't. He dropped it. His coach talked
 to him but he smiled at the coach. He couldn't forgive himself for not
 winning the game.
_____ 8. The stars were shining brightly in the night sky. The evening breeze 
 felt cool on my skin. It was the last night of summer break and I was 
 calm. It's not that I was excited to go back to school. School is a lot of 
 work for me. But I was excited to see my friends again, and I knew 
 that they are also excited to see me too.
_____ 9. The dew on the grass made my running shoes damp. It didn't bother
 me. The sound of my feet hitting the street formed a rhythm, a steady
 pattern of light thumps. I timed my breathing with the rhythm. These 
 sounds filled my head. I thought of nothing other than the next step 
 and keeping my tempo. I soared over the sidewalks like concrete
 clouds.
_____ 10. If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your 
 hand and ask for help immediately. Do it while your teacher is still 
 explaining the material. Your teacher will probably be happy that you 
 are taking an active part in your education. If you are still confused, 
 ask your teacher if he or she is available after class to give you 
 additional instruction. You are worth it. Don't give up on yourself.</a>

                                            Excerpt from "Home But Unwanted by Rev. Fr. Eugene Elivera As a young man he was in Germany in the late thirties, as Adolf Hitler was gaining strength, and he had brought home records of Hitler speaking. I remember him playing these for my brother and me and telling us if ever we hear such a forceful speaker, we should run like mad the other way! He retired when he was about 62 and he and my mother moved to Arizona, where he could play tennis every day, and drive up to Grand Canyon on weekends. He loved the hot, and weather in Arizona and the wide opened spaces and the rabbits that cavorted around their backyard, and the birds, especially the quails who frequently stopped traffic by marching their families across the street But still the protestant was still determined to be useful: he did pro bono tax counseling in one of the banks for a month or so before tax deadlines each year, and he read for the blind under the local Lions Club, sornetimes reading Shakespeare and other classical literature to ease the way for blind students taking college courses. And he continued to travel He had always loved traveling. He would ask my mother over a drink one night whether she had ever thought about going to Iceland, for instance, and no matter what she said, he would come home a few days later with pamphlets from his travel agent -and within a few months at most, they would be in Iceland. He was fortunate enough to live well for 20 years after he refired, and to have been traveling and playing tennis a month before he died. Some medical tests he had prior to taking his last trip to Europe revealed some blocked arteries, but he went off on the trip without knowing this. But he knew he didn't feel well and after hearing from his doctor, he decided to return to the US and undergo the surgery. This at first appeared to be successful, but afterwards the doctors found they were unable to stop the bleeding. He did not regain consciousness after the operation 1.

                                            6. Queenie woke up late one Monday morning. She was fifteen minute late. She rushed out of her house and forgot to bring her umbrella. She ran to school in the rain. Her uniform, shoes and school bag were all wet. 7. Edward looked from the sun. He was thinking about the game. They could have won. He could have won the game for them. All he needed to do was catch the ball, but he didn't. He dropped it. His coach talked to him but he smiled at the coach. He couldn't forgive himself for not winning the game. 8. The stars were shining brightly in the night sky. The evening breeze felt cool on my skin. It was the last night of summer break and I was calm. It's not that I was excited to go back to school. School is a lot of work for me. But I was excited to see my friends again, and I knew that they are also excited to see me too. 9. The dew on the grass made my running shoes damp. It didn't bother me. The sound of my feet hitting the street formed a rhythm, a steady pattern of light thumps. I timed my breathing with the rhythm. These sounds filled my head. I thought of nothing other than the next step and keeping my tempo. I soared over the sidewalks like concrete clouds. 10. If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your hand and ask for help immediately. Do it while your teacher is still explaining the material. Your teacher will probably be happy that you are taking an active part in your education. If you are still confused, ask your teacher if he or she is available after class to give you additional instruction. You are worth it. Don't give up on yourself.​</a>

_____ 7. Edward looked from the sun. He was thinking about the game. They
 could have won. He could have won the game for them. All he needed
 to do was catch the ball, but he didn't. He dropped it. His coach talked
 to him but he smiled at the coach. He couldn't forgive himself for not
 winning the game.
_____ 8. The stars were shining brightly in the night sky. The evening breeze 
 felt cool on my skin. It was the last night of summer break and I was 
 calm. It's not that I was excited to go back to school. School is a lot of 
 work for me. But I was excited to see my friends again, and I knew 
 that they are also excited to see me too.
_____ 9. The dew on the grass made my running shoes damp. It didn't bother
 me. The sound of my feet hitting the street formed a rhythm, a steady
 pattern of light thumps. I timed my breathing with the rhythm. These 
 sounds filled my head. I thought of nothing other than the next step 
 and keeping my tempo. I soared over the sidewalks like concrete
 clouds.
_____ 10. If you are confused about something in class, don't wait. Raise your 
 hand and ask for help immediately. Do it while your teacher is still 
 explaining the material. Your teacher will probably be happy that you 
 are taking an active part in your education. If you are still confused, 
 ask your teacher if he or she is available after class to give you 
 additional instruction. You are worth it. Don't give up on yourself.</h2><br />

                            8. Excerpt from "Home But Unwanted by Rev. Fr. Eugene Elivera As a young man he was in Germany in the late thirties, as Adolf Hitler was gaining strength, and he had brought home records of Hitler speaking. I remember him playing these for my brother and me and telling us if ever we hear such a forceful speaker, we should run like mad the other way! He retired when he was about 62 and he and my mother moved to Arizona, where he could play tennis every day, and drive up to Grand Canyon on weekends. He loved the hot, and weather in Arizona and the wide opened spaces and the rabbits that cavorted around their backyard, and the birds, especially the quails who frequently stopped traffic by marching their families across the street But still the protestant was still determined to be useful: he did pro bono tax counseling in one of the banks for a month or so before tax deadlines each year, and he read for the blind under the local Lions Club, sornetimes reading Shakespeare and other classical literature to ease the way for blind students taking college courses. And he continued to travel He had always loved traveling. He would ask my mother over a drink one night whether she had ever thought about going to Iceland, for instance, and no matter what she said, he would come home a few days later with pamphlets from his travel agent -and within a few months at most, they would be in Iceland. He was fortunate enough to live well for 20 years after he refired, and to have been traveling and playing tennis a month before he died. Some medical tests he had prior to taking his last trip to Europe revealed some blocked arteries, but he went off on the trip without knowing this. But he knew he didn't feel well and after hearing from his doctor, he decided to return to the US and undergo the surgery. This at first appeared to be successful, but afterwards the doctors found they were unable to stop the bleeding. He did not regain consciousness after the operation 1.
