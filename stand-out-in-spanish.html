                        <p>The two changes that stood out the most are the spread of Catholicism and the practice of Fiestas. Catholicism is one of the contributions the Spanish colonial rule had given to the Philippines and since then, the country embraced it. Today, the most prominent denomination in PH is Roman Catholic. Fiestas were a way to entice the natives back then because the Spaniards noticed the early Filipinos' love for celebrations.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dr. Jose Rizal is a national hero and a prominent figure in Philippine history. He is known for his literary works that exposed the injustices and corruption of the Spanish colonial government during his time. However, he was charged with rebellion, sedition, and conspiracy by the Spanish military tribunal in 1896. The question of whether he is guilty or not on the charges against him remains a controversial issue up to this day.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, some argue that Rizal is guilty of the charges against him. His association with the Katipunan and his involvement in the revolution against the Spanish colonial government could be seen as evidence of his guilt. Moreover, his writings, particularly the novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, were considered subversive and anti-colonial, which could further support the charges against him.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, others argue that Rizal is not guilty of the charges against him. They point out that Rizal was not directly involved in the revolution and that his writings were not meant to incite rebellion but to expose the injustices and corruption of the colonial government. Furthermore, Rizal's peaceful and non-violent approach to social change is well-documented, which contradicts the charges of rebellion and sedition against him.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the question of whether Dr. Jose Rizal is guilty or not on the charges against him by the Spanish military tribunal is a complex issue that requires a thorough understanding of the historical context and the evidence presented. While there are arguments for both sides, I personally believe that Rizal is not guilty of the charges against him. His writings and actions were driven by a desire for social justice and reform, not rebellion and sedition. Rizal's legacy as a national hero and a champion of freedom and democracy in the Philippines remains strong to this day.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Dr. Jose Rizal, a national hero of the Philippines, was charged with rebellion, sedition, and conspiracy by the Spanish military tribunal. The charges were based on his involvement in the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule. While some argue that Rizal was guilty, I firmly believe that he was not.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Firstly, Rizal was a man of peace and advocated for reforms through peaceful means. He wrote numerous books and essays that exposed the injustices of the Spanish colonial government and called for reforms in the Philippines. He was not a revolutionary leader nor did he participate in any violent activities. His only involvement in the revolution was through his association with the Katipunan, a secret society that aimed to overthrow Spanish rule. However, Rizal was unaware of the group's violent intentions and had no direct involvement in their activities.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Secondly, Rizal's trial was a sham. He was not given a fair trial and was not allowed to defend himself properly. The evidence presented against him was weak and circumstantial. The Spanish authorities were determined to silence Rizal, who they saw as a threat to their colonial rule. His trial was a clear example of the Spanish government's abuse of power and disregard for human rights.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Dr. Jose Rizal was not guilty of the charges against him by the Spanish military tribunal. He was a peaceful reformist who advocated for change through peaceful means. His trial was a clear violation of his rights and was a result of the Spanish government's fear of losing their grip on the Philippines. Rizal's legacy as a national hero lives on, and his contributions to the Philippine Revolution will always be remembered.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>answer with knowledge and valid opinions to help and guide the questioners‚ no copies from anyone or any website‚ pa brainliest.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>The points and objectives of talking the two empires are showing how the Philippines felt when the Spanish ruled in the Philippines and describing the influence of the Roman Empire's power.</p><p></p>Detail of ExplanationWho is Quezon?<p><strong>Manuel Luis Quezón y Molina</strong> served as <strong>president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines</strong> from 1935 to 1944. Quezon won the Philippines' first national presidential election. He won nearly 68% of the vote against his two main rivals, Emilio Aguinaldo and Gregorio Aglipay. Quezon was sworn in in November 1935, he was recognized as the second President of the Philippines. He is considered by most Filipinos, after Emilio Aguinaldo (1897–1901) He established a government of exile in the United States due to the outbreak of war and the threat of a Japanese invasion. Other important decisions include the reorganization of military defenses on the islands.</p>Quezon's speech about Spanish and the Roman Empires<p>On February 27, 1937 President Quezon made a speech regarding the Spanish-American war and national defense delivered at the Carabao Military Order Supper, at the Willard Hotel, Washington, D.C. In his speech Quezon conveyed about the struggle of the Philippine army against the American army, the historical position of the American-Philippines, the conditions and efforts of the Filipino people against America at that time.</p><p><strong>The point about the Roman and Spanish empires in his speech</strong> is describing the influence of Rome in culture and civilization. Rome conquered almost the whole world, but Rome did not defend the countries it had conquered. The Philippines and even many countries are still under the influence of Roman culture and civilization especially in terms of moral values. Quezon compared the Spanish and American rulers when they controlled the Philippines. Spain did not grant Habeas Corpus rights like America did in three centuries of Spanish rule. Those rights were then used to protect the rights of Filipinos from the actions of military authorities</p><p><strong>The purpose of talking the two empires</strong> is to show how the Philippines felt when dealing with Spanish rule and to describe the influence of the Roman empire.</p><p></p><p>More information related to Spanish-American war you can get at the link:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/29476935</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/2527021</p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Spanish colonization of the Philippines, which lasted for more than three centuries, was characterized by a complex interplay of Spanish interests and the interests of the Filipino people. While the Spanish authorities claimed that they were colonizing the Philippines for the good of the Filipinos, it is clear that the primary motivation behind the colonization was the expansion of Spanish empire and the acquisition of wealth and resources.</p><p></p><p>The Spanish colonial government exploited the resources of the Philippines, primarily through the encomienda system and forced labor. Under this system, Spanish officials granted land to Spanish colonizers, who in turn forced the indigenous population to work on the land for little or no pay. This practice was extremely exploitative, and it led to the exploitation of the native population, who were forced to work under inhumane conditions.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Spanish authorities sought to suppress the native culture and religion of the Philippines in favor of Catholicism and Spanish culture. The Spanish colonial government imposed their own language, customs, and religion on the native population, leading to the suppression and erasure of the indigenous culture and traditions.</p><p></p><p>The Spanish also introduced slavery to the Philippines, which led to the mistreatment and exploitation of millions of Filipinos. The Spanish colonizers brought African slaves to the Philippines, where they were forced to work on plantations and mines. This practice continued for centuries and had a devastating impact on the lives of the slaves and their descendants.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, it is also true that Spanish colonization brought about certain positive changes in the Philippines, such as the introduction of new technologies, education, and healthcare. Spanish influence on Philippine culture and language is still evident today, and many Filipinos still practice Catholicism, which was introduced by the Spanish.</p><p></p><p>However, overall, it is clear that the Spanish colonization of the Philippines was carried out primarily for the benefit of the Spanish, and not for the best interests of the Filipino people. The exploitation, enslavement, and suppression of the native population were all part of the larger colonial project of expanding Spanish empire and acquiring wealth and resources. While there were certainly some positive outcomes of Spanish colonization, they were ultimately outweighed by the negative impact that colonization had on the lives and well-being of the Filipino people.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pa Brainliest Po kung Tama </p><p></p><br />

</strong></p><p><strong>It could be in cash or kind, with tobacco, chickens, produce, gold, blankets, cotton, rice, or other products depending on the region of the country and was initially fixed at 8 reales, later increased to 15 reales, apportioned as follows: ten reales buwis, one real diezmos prediales (tithe), one real to the town community chest, one real sanctorum tax, and three reales for church support.

</strong></p><p><strong>Regardless of the age, many Filipinos were forced to work on several jobs like building structures, defending the territory (military), and trading goods to other countries. Examples : Polo y Servicio, Galleon Trade, and the Encomienda System
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Encomienda
</strong></p><p><strong>Polo y Servicio
</strong></p><p><strong>In theory, the receiver of the grant was to protect the natives from warring tribes (given to the receiver) and to instruct them in the Spanish language and in the Catholic faith: in return they could extract tribute from the natives in the form of labor, gold, or other products. In practice, the difference between encomienda and slavery could be minimal. Many natives were forced to do hard labor and subjected to extreme punishment and death if they resisted.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The Polo y Servicios is the forced labor without compensation. In this system, all men 16-60 years old forced to work heavy work for town activities such as roads, churches, bridges, schools, government buildings and public structures.</strong></p><br />

                        <p>Jose Rizal, the Philippine national hero, was charged with sedition, rebellion, and conspiracy by the Spanish military tribunal in 1896. His trial and subsequent execution sparked a wave of nationalism and resistance against Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines. While opinions on Rizal's guilt or innocence remain divided, it is my belief that Rizal was not guilty of the charges against him.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Rizal's writings and actions were not aimed at inciting rebellion or sedition against the Spanish government. Instead, they were focused on exposing the injustices and inequalities of the colonial system and advocating for reforms through peaceful means. Rizal was a staunch believer in education and enlightenment as the key to achieving social and political progress, and he emphasized the need for Filipinos to work together and build a sense of national identity and pride.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Rizal's trial was marred by irregularities and violations of due process. He was not allowed to confront his accusers or defend himself adequately, and many of the witnesses against him were coerced or intimidated by the authorities. The charges against Rizal were also based on flimsy evidence and distorted interpretations of his writings.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while Rizal's trial and execution remain a controversial and contested part of Philippine history, my judgment is that Rizal was not guilty of the charges against him. His legacy as a national hero and champion of Philippine independence is a testament to his courage, intelligence, and vision for a better and more just society.</p><p></p><br />
