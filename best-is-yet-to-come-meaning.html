                                            There was a woman who discovered too late that her body was being eaten up by can- cer. She was advised by various physicians to undergo surgery and remove a part of her body where the cancer cells originated. It was believed that the procedure would lengthen her days on earth. She prayed for her situation, asking God to teach her what is best in such circumstance. Her friends advised her to listen to the doctors. But she heard an inner voice. Life is beautiful. Yet the end is certain because even if the surgery will be successful, the day for death will still come around. She, therefore, started to tread on a path that is full of hope and trust. She did all possible ways to delay the spread of cancer-all natural means except for the doctor's knife to cut through her body, for she had begun to hope for a natural cure, or to face death courageously. Spiritual persons accompanied her in this unique journey; from many parts of the Philippines, communities offered prayers for her. She did not feel bitter; nor did she blame the Lord despite the pain she suffered daily. She continued to believe that God's wisdom will ultimately decide her fate. Her body succumbed to the evil of cancer after only five months, but her spirit is still undefeated. She returned to the Maker with a smile on her lips and a firm faith that she will be united with God in the afterlife. When she gave up her last breath, her face was radiant and calm. She looked beautiful. Her last days spoke of her brave encounter with life and death. 1.

SalazarMy life’s tomorrow beckons meFrom distant mountains high and low;My future seems a boundless sea,Where moving passions come and go.Deep in my heart ambition dwells;He cheers me up the highland,And guide me through the hills and dellsWhere I pass the busy day.I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen,But I can love with Shakespeare’s heart;I love his skill his craft of men,His mastery of poet’s art.I do not care for fame, as he,Enthroned was like unto a god:The depths he reached are dark to me.But I will grope the ways he tried.I wear achievement’s coronet.For best are they who see things done!And all my cares I soon forgetThen I have wrought my work alone.If I be met by adverse fate,And all my dreams but in vain;Then, must I work the harder yetWith high resolve to try again.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The lines "I cannot write with Shakespeare’s pen, but I can love with Shakespeare’s heart" suggest that while the author may not have the same level of talent or skill as Shakespeare when it comes to writing, they are still capable of expressing emotions and feelings through their own writing. They may not be able to replicate Shakespeare's precise and intricate use of language, but they can tap into the same depth of emotion and passion that Shakespeare infused in his work. The author admires Shakespeare's skill and mastery of the poet's art, but they do not necessarily aspire to the same level of fame and recognition. Instead, they focus on achieving their own goals and aspirations, and are determined to keep trying even in the face of adversity.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>h</strong></p><br />

                            12. There was a woman who discovered too late that her body was being eaten up by can- cer. She was advised by various physicians to undergo surgery and remove a part of her body where the cancer cells originated. It was believed that the procedure would lengthen her days on earth. She prayed for her situation, asking God to teach her what is best in such circumstance. Her friends advised her to listen to the doctors. But she heard an inner voice. Life is beautiful. Yet the end is certain because even if the surgery will be successful, the day for death will still come around. She, therefore, started to tread on a path that is full of hope and trust. She did all possible ways to delay the spread of cancer-all natural means except for the doctor's knife to cut through her body, for she had begun to hope for a natural cure, or to face death courageously. Spiritual persons accompanied her in this unique journey; from many parts of the Philippines, communities offered prayers for her. She did not feel bitter; nor did she blame the Lord despite the pain she suffered daily. She continued to believe that God's wisdom will ultimately decide her fate. Her body succumbed to the evil of cancer after only five months, but her spirit is still undefeated. She returned to the Maker with a smile on her lips and a firm faith that she will be united with God in the afterlife. When she gave up her last breath, her face was radiant and calm. She looked beautiful. Her last days spoke of her brave encounter with life and death. 1.
