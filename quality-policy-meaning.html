                                            "The Future Gender Equality" Robert Grant The future Gender equality Recruiters are key to gender solution, says Robert Grant Recruiters know about hiring, but they could- and arguably should be more influential to businesses around issues of gender equality. But this comes with responsibility and the need for any chosen recruiter to prioritise diversity as a business objective. Monitoring diversity means recruiters can address discrepancies. For example, equally qualified and sometimes more qualified women are not equally hired. Women's tenure is higher in banks than for men and fewer women are employed in the digital industry. To stay competitive, businesses must encourage hiring managers to understand the implications of these trends and should work in partnership with recruiters. Only by investing in good programs can recruiters properly support clients. IT systems that allow monitoring of all relevant diversity across both the internal employee and candidate recruitment lifecycle are now critical to good quality intelligence. Staff should be expected to work to inclusion guiding principles, but businesses need support systems in place and investment in on-going development on the value of diversity to the business. In 2013 Cititec is developing its people in strengths-based leadership. The next step is to use the strengths-based approach in recruitment. cititec man recruitment for a technical w Communicating transparency, especially in equal pay and flexible working, are critical. "Early in 2013 we launched a new Flexible Working Policy. Some of the barriers highlighted during the consultation period helped avoid ill feeling from people who may cover for their colleagues and for non-careers who sometimes feel their needs are overlooked. Now anyone can ask for flexible working and new IT systems mean we have the ability to support them," explains Cititec's CEO Stephen Grant. "Consequently there has been an increase of 33 per cent in senior women employed so far." Later in the year Cititec and Sateo, a specialist equality consultancy, will Citite Development launch Program. Aimed at internal staff, candidates, and clients, the program will bring men and women together to develop key leadership skills based on the strengths finder model. Only by recruiters investing in equality and working in partnership with clients, can issues around gender be explored alongside a problem solving approach. True gender equality can therefore start to be realized, and recruiters are the key to the solution. Directions: Read carefully the article, "The Future Gender Equality".

                            14. "The Future Gender Equality" Robert Grant The future Gender equality Recruiters are key to gender solution, says Robert Grant Recruiters know about hiring, but they could- and arguably should be more influential to businesses around issues of gender equality. But this comes with responsibility and the need for any chosen recruiter to prioritise diversity as a business objective. Monitoring diversity means recruiters can address discrepancies. For example, equally qualified and sometimes more qualified women are not equally hired. Women's tenure is higher in banks than for men and fewer women are employed in the digital industry. To stay competitive, businesses must encourage hiring managers to understand the implications of these trends and should work in partnership with recruiters. Only by investing in good programs can recruiters properly support clients. IT systems that allow monitoring of all relevant diversity across both the internal employee and candidate recruitment lifecycle are now critical to good quality intelligence. Staff should be expected to work to inclusion guiding principles, but businesses need support systems in place and investment in on-going development on the value of diversity to the business. In 2013 Cititec is developing its people in strengths-based leadership. The next step is to use the strengths-based approach in recruitment. cititec man recruitment for a technical w Communicating transparency, especially in equal pay and flexible working, are critical. "Early in 2013 we launched a new Flexible Working Policy. Some of the barriers highlighted during the consultation period helped avoid ill feeling from people who may cover for their colleagues and for non-careers who sometimes feel their needs are overlooked. Now anyone can ask for flexible working and new IT systems mean we have the ability to support them," explains Cititec's CEO Stephen Grant. "Consequently there has been an increase of 33 per cent in senior women employed so far." Later in the year Cititec and Sateo, a specialist equality consultancy, will Citite Development launch Program. Aimed at internal staff, candidates, and clients, the program will bring men and women together to develop key leadership skills based on the strengths finder model.

On Small-Scale Farming
by Jhonathan S. Cadavido
Carabaos and cows are important farm animals. [1] (Together with/Similar) other animals, they both help farmers in producing milk and other farm and dairy products. Meat, [2] (namely/for example), is one of the most important products that both of them can provide. [3] (Besides/Moreover), milk is also an essential item that carabaos and cows produce. [4] (In fact/Indeed), kesong puti is good for breakfast as spread or stuffing for varieties of bread [5] (that is/such as) pandesal and loaf bread. [6] (Therefore/Indeed), cows and carabaos can produce food items that we need in our daily lives.
Last year, we had to sell dozens of carabaos and cows for my parents to financially support me with my studies. [7] (As a result/Accordingly), my family recorded and generated small return of investment for that year. [8] (Instead/Although) we suffered a great loss, we still managed to survive with the help of my uncle.
Uncle Romeo has lent us his resources. [9] (On the other hand/Together with) this, he looked for possible investors who would finance our small farm business. [10] (Consequently/Meanwhile), a known dairy company, invested large amount of money to our small-scale farm. We accepted its offer. [11] (In fact/Wherefore), we have already started the expansion of our farm. From 20 remaining cows and carabaos, we now have at least hundreds of them. Our humble farm can now provide a large amount of milk products to our partner-company. [12] (For instance/Henceforth), we can at least supply them 500 liters of milk per day [13] (importantly/notwithstanding) the El Niño phenomenon that we are currently experiencing.
[14] (As a result/Similar) of this success, our family is planning to further expand our business venture, [15] (for example/to demonstrate), production of other farm products from hogs and chicken. [16] (Coupled with/Whereas) our dedication and enthusiasm, our partner-company has pledged to continuously support us in this endeavor. [17] (Comparatively/In fact), we are now working on our feasibility study about this concept. [18] (Consequently/Furthermore), other government policies and bank loans are considered for this project.
[19] (In conclusion/Otherwise), starting a business is not really an easy task, [20] (even more/indeed) a difficult one. [21] (Instead/While) others may not believe in your capacity, it is your duty to trust yourself and the process. With faith and confidence, you will surely achieve your dreams. From carabaos and cows, our small farm will soon be one of the famous haciendas in town producing and delivering quality products and goods.</h2><br />
