11. Violet pulled her hair back into a ponytail. She was stressed. For the third time this week, a teacher was going to call her home and she knew that she wouldn't be able to talk her way out of this one. She thought that she would try anyway. "Come on, Mr. Jones," she pleaded. "I didn't mean to do it. I just held out my hand and he ran into it." Mr. Jones smirked and replied, "Yeah, nice try, Violet, but here's the deal. When one of my students gets hurt, we call homes and that's it." Violet buried her face in her palms. *

12. The sun was beginning to set. Light rays pierced through the hills and I could see the stars awakening on the other side of the sky, but I did not want to go home. "Give me one more try. I'll get it this time," I pleaded with Jake. He tilted his head to the side, crinkled his face, and said, "Look, if you couldn't do it the last thousand times, you're probably not going to get it right now. Why don't you get your own skateboard, then you can work on your tricks all day and night?" He was right. I needed to get my own skateboard. *

13. "You can't do it. You'll never do it," said my cousin Victor as I stood at the free-throw line. I turned around so that my back was to the hoop and began bending backward. I could now see the hoop, but it was upside down. I held the ball against my inverted chest. "Come on, you know you can't do it. Just take the letter," Victor continued goading me but I wasn't trying to hear that nonsense. I wound back and released the ball. It flew from my hands in a perfect arc and soared directly over the backboard. "I told you so," Victor said smugly.

                                            Pa help poNow we analyze what Cinderella said to Bruno. Proletariat will always look up to the bourgeoisie, this was due to false conscience planted on their head. Proletariat dreamed about a way of life like bourgeoisie, a life surrounded by luxury and privileges. What Cinderella said to Bruno the dog was the example. She said to Bruno if he does not want to lose his place to sleep, he should learn to like the cat. Cinderella was a depiction of proletariat in this movie, she always suffers from chores, household duties and many kinds of work assigned to her by her stepmother and stepsisters. She does not have a free time for her own and she must work from dawn until night, somehow, she developed a mental state that made her look up to a condition where she does not have to work or taking orders anymore. In that sense Cinderella become a proletariat and think that living a good life means you have to be a bourgeoisie. What Cinderella implied in that word was Bruno the dog must learn to like Lucifer the cat, the proletariat must be able to like bourgeoisie in order to achieve that goal."

Proletariat dreamed about a way of life like bourgeoisie, a life surrounded by luxury and privileges. What Cinderella said to Bruno the dog was the example. She said to Bruno if he does not want to lose his place to sleep, he should learn to like the cat. Cinderella was a depiction of proletariat in this movie, she always suffers from chores, household duties and many kinds of work assigned to her by her stepmother and stepsisters.
