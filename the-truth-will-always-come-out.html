                                            11.There was once a shepherd boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a forest. His life waspretty boring, so he thought of a plan to amuse himself and have a little fun. He ran towards the village calling out "Wolf!Wolf!" and the villagers came out to help him, only to find him laughing like a hyena. The boy enjoyed his trick verymuch, so the next day he tried it again, and fooled the villagers for the second time. But shortly after this, a wolf actuallydid come out from the forest and began to chase the sheep, and the boy of course cried out again, "Wolf! Wolf." But thistime, the villagers didn't pay attention to him, thinking the boy was playing again with them. So the Wolf made a goodmeal of the boy's flock and then went back into the forest4.

                                            The Discontented Pendulum
FACE: Okay, tell me. . . who among did it?
WHEELS AND WEIGHTS [Aloud]: Surely not we!
HANDS: Don’t look at us. It’s not we either.
PENDULUM [Sheepishly]: I did it! The truth is. . . I’m tired of tick-tocking and swaying for
fifty years. I give up!
FACE [Angrily]: You lazy thing! How could you!
PENDULUM: It is easy for you, Lady Face, to set yourself above me and accuse me of laziness.
You do nothing but look pretty and stare at people and watch all that go in and on in the kitchen.
How would you like to be in the dark closet and do nothing but wag back and forth year after
year like I do? I’m tired of my life. After thinking it over last night, I figured out how many
times in a month do I have to tick while the Hour Hand just goes around once. Do you have
any idea how many times that is?
MINUTE HAND [Brightly speaking up]: Forty-three thousand two hundred times!
PENDULUM: Right! And in one week, how many times must I wag?
MINUTE HAND [Thinking]: Ten thousand eighty.
PENDULUM: Exactly! And in one year?
3
MINUTE HAND [Thinking harder]:. .Er-r-r. Let me think.
HOUR HAND: Take your time, dear; you can do it.
MINUTE HAND [Shouting]: Thirty-one million four hundred and forty-nine thousand six
hundred! Half ticks and half ticks. There is silence. Everyone waits for the Pendulum to say
whether the answer is correct or not. And then. .
PENDULUM: Very good, smart fellow! Now, you all see why I’m tired of ticktocking. It’s too
much to ask of anyone. So please count me out.
FACE: Mr. Pendulum, would you mind wagging six times, only six times to please a lady?
PENDULUM: With pleasure! Here. . . tick-tock, tick-tock.
FACE: Thank you, I hope it did not tire you.
PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not tire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand,
but when it comes to thirty-one million. . . ugh! That’s too much to ask of anyone.
FACE: It tires you to think about all those wags, but it does not tire you to wag one wag at a
time. Isn’t that true?
PENDULUM: Yes, but thirty-one million!
FACE: You say it in a minute, but you have to do it a whole long year---winter, summer, spring,
and fall. Think about it. Nobody hurries you.
HOUR HAND: Look at it this way. Spring cannot come until you have comfortably tick-tocked
so many million more times.
MINUTE HAND: And the leaves cannot turn red in autumn, and Jack Frost cannot appear
before you give the signal.
FACE: You see. Time is in your hands and so much depends on you. Would you rather let
people down?
PENDULUM [Overjoyed]: That’s so! I’m an important person! [Jumping] Ye-hey! You’re
right! I don’t have to rush. There’s always a year’s tick-tocking. So, all get back to work.
ALL: Yeah, back to work!
With this, the Wheels begin to turn; the Hands begin to move. Lady Face smiles brightly and
the Pendulum proudly sways back and forth---tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock---as if nothing
Happened.

Why and why not?_________________________________________________________________________5. How can you make others happy in your own way?_______________________________The Happiest Boy in the Worldby: NVM GonzalezJulio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to goto school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had leftTablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schoolingfor a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him astenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to bevisiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call eachother compadre."Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece ofpaper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to themunicipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to hisgreat surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talkedwith the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was surethat he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso."It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He'sin the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, Ithought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little wayacross stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempenmosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaosthat he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barokriver, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, likea tired youth; but he was only twelve.The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, offish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floorseemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, ifJulio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blowthen; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then hecontinued with his letter."This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only lethim stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished youcould almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was aservant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt whichyour feet had left on the floor."I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best tophrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard hisletter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.​</a>

The Happiest Boy in the World
by: NVM Gonzalez
Julio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,
ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to go
to school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had left
Tablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schooling
for a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him as
tenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to be
visiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call each
other compadre.
"Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece of
paper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,
he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the
municipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to his
great surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talked
with the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was sure
that he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso.
"It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He's
in the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, I
thought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."
He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,
the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little way
across stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempen
mosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaos
that he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barok
river, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, like
a tired youth; but he was only twelve.
The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, of
fish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floor
seemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, if
Julio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blow
then; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,
and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then he
continued with his letter.
"This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only let
him stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.
He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."
Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.
he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished you
could almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was a
servant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt which
your feet had left on the floor.
"I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best to
phrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard his
letter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.</a>

The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then slipped away
into the forest.
Moral: If you keep lying, no one will believe you even if you are
speaking the truth. Always speak the truth.

                                            The Two Brothers
Leo Tolstoy
Two brothers set out on a joumey together. At noon they lay out on a forest to rest. When they woke up they say
a stone lying next to them. There was something written on the stone, and they tried to make out what it was.
"Whoever finds this stone, let him go straight to the forest at sunrise. In the forest, a river will appear, let him swim
across the river to the other side. There he will see a she-bear and her cubs. Let him take the cubs from her and run
up the mountain with them, without looking back. On the top of the mountain, he will see a house, and in that house
he will find happiness."
When they had read what was written on the stone, the younger brother said: "Let us go together. We can swim
across the river, carry off the bear cubs, take them to the house on the mountain, and together they find happiness."
1 am not going into the forest after bear cubs," said the elder brother, "and I advise you not to go. In the first
place, no one can know whether what is written on this stone is the truth -perhaps it was written in jest... In the
second place, even if what is written here is the truth-suppose we go into the forest and night comes, and we cannot
find the river. We shall be lost. And if we do find the river, how are we going to swim across it? In the third place, even
if we swim across the river, do you think it is an easy thing to take her cubs away from a she-bear? She will seize us,
and instead of finding happiness, we shall perish and all for nothing. And, most of all, the stone does not tell us what
kind of happiness we should find in that house. It may be that the happiness awalting us there is not at all the sort of
happiness we would want."
The younger brother replied, "In my opinion, you are wrong. What is written on the stone could not have been
put there without reason. And it is all perfectly clear. In the first place, no harm will come to us if we try. In the second
place, if we do not go, someone else will read the inscription on the stone and find happiness, and we shall have lost
it all. In the third place, if you do not make an effort and try hard, nothing in the world will succeed. In the fourth place,
I should not want it thought that I was afraid of anything."
And so, the younger brother followed all the instructions on the stone. When he reached the top of the mountain
the people came out to take him to the city, where they made him their king. He ruled for five years, but in the sixth
year, another king waged war against him. The city was conquered, and he was driven out.
Again, the younger brother became a wandered, and he arrived one day at the house of the elder brother. The
brother was living in a village and had grown neither rich nor poor. The two brothers rejoiced at seeing each other, and
at once began telling of all that happened to them.
"You see," said the elder brother, "I was right. Here I have lived quietly and well, whole you, though you may have
been a king, have seen a great deal of trouble."
1 do not regret having gone into the forest and up the mountain," replied the younger brother. "I may have nothing
now, but I shall always have 
something to remember, while you have no memories at all."

His life waspretty boring, so he thought of a plan to amuse himself and have a little fun. He ran towards the village calling out "Wolf!Wolf!" and the villagers came out to help him, only to find him laughing like a hyena. The boy enjoyed his trick verymuch, so the next day he tried it again, and fooled the villagers for the second time. But shortly after this, a wolf actuallydid come out from the forest and began to chase the sheep, and the boy of course cried out again, "Wolf! Wolf."

MINUTE HAND [Thinking harder]:. .Er-r-r. Let me think.
HOUR HAND: Take your time, dear; you can do it.
MINUTE HAND [Shouting]: Thirty-one million four hundred and forty-nine thousand six
hundred! Half ticks and half ticks. There is silence. Everyone waits for the Pendulum to say
whether the answer is correct or not. And then. .
PENDULUM: Very good, smart fellow! Now, you all see why I’m tired of ticktocking. It’s too
much to ask of anyone. So please count me out.
FACE: Mr. Pendulum, would you mind wagging six times, only six times to please a lady?
PENDULUM: With pleasure! Here. . . tick-tock, tick-tock.
FACE: Thank you, I hope it did not tire you.
PENDULUM: Of course not. Sixty times would not tire me, nor six hundred, nor six thousand,
but when it comes to thirty-one million. . . ugh! That’s too much to ask of anyone.
FACE: It tires you to think about all those wags, but it does not tire you to wag one wag at a
time. Isn’t that true?
PENDULUM: Yes, but thirty-one million!
FACE: You say it in a minute, but you have to do it a whole long year---winter, summer, spring,
and fall. Think about it. Nobody hurries you.
HOUR HAND: Look at it this way. Spring cannot come until you have comfortably tick-tocked
so many million more times.
MINUTE HAND: And the leaves cannot turn red in autumn, and Jack Frost cannot appear
before you give the signal.
FACE: You see. Time is in your hands and so much depends on you. Would you rather let
people down?
PENDULUM [Overjoyed]: That’s so! I’m an important person! [Jumping] Ye-hey! You’re
right! I don’t have to rush. There’s always a year’s tick-tocking. So, all get back to work.
ALL: Yeah, back to work!
With this, the Wheels begin to turn; the Hands begin to move. Lady Face smiles brightly and
the Pendulum proudly sways back and forth---tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock---as if nothing
Happened.

Why and why not?_________________________________________________________________________5. How can you make others happy in your own way?_______________________________The Happiest Boy in the Worldby: NVM GonzalezJulio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to goto school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had leftTablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schoolingfor a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him astenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to bevisiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call eachother compadre."Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece ofpaper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to themunicipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to hisgreat surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talkedwith the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was surethat he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso."It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He'sin the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, Ithought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little wayacross stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempenmosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaosthat he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barokriver, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, likea tired youth; but he was only twelve.The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, offish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floorseemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, ifJulio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blowthen; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then hecontinued with his letter."This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only lethim stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished youcould almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was aservant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt whichyour feet had left on the floor."I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best tophrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard hisletter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.​</h2><br />

The Happiest Boy in the World
by: NVM Gonzalez
Julio, who had come from Tables to settle in Barok, was writing a letter to, of all people,
ka Ponso, his landlord, one warm June night. It was about his son, Jose, who wanted to go
to school in Mansalay that year. Jose was in the fifth grade when Julio and his family had left
Tablas the year before and migrated to Mindoro. Because the father had to stop schooling
for a year. As it was, Julio though himself lucky enough to have ka Ponso to take him as
tenant. Later when Julio’s wife, Fidela, gave birth to a baby. Ka Ponso, who happened to be
visiting his property then, offered to become its godfather. After that they began to call each
other compadre.
"Dear Compadre,"Julio started to write in Tagalog bending earnestly over a piece of
paper which he had torn out of Jose's notebook. It was many months ago when, just as now,
he had sat down with a writing implement in his hand. That was when he had gone to the
municipio in Mansalay to file a homestead application, and he had used a pen, and to his
great surprise filled in the blank forms neatly. Nothing came of the application and talked
with the officials concerned. Now, with a pencil instead of a pen to write with, Julio was sure
that he could make his letter legible enough for Ka Ponso.
"It's about my boy Jose, "he wrote on. "I want him to study this June in Mansalay. He's
in the sixth grade now, and since he's quite a poor hand at looking after your carabaos, I
thought it would be best that he goes to school in the town."
He sat back and learned against the wall. He had been writing on a low wooden bench,
the sole piece of furniture in the one-room house. There he sat in one corner. A little way
across stood the stove; to his right Fidela and the baby girl, Felipa lay under the hempen
mosquito net. Jose, who had been out all afternoon looking for one of Ka Ponso's carabaos
that he had strayed away to the newly planted rice clearings along the other side of the Barok
river, was here too, sprawing beside a sack of palay by the doorway. He snored lightly, like
a tired youth; but he was only twelve.
The kerosene lamp's yellow flame flickered ceaselessly. The dank smell of food, of
fish broth particularly, that had been spilled from many a bowl and had dried on the floor
seemed to rise from the very texture of the wood itself. The sad truth about their poverty, if
Julio’s nature had been sensitive to it, might have struck him with a hard and sudden blow
then; but as it was, he just looked about the room, even as the smell assailed his nostrils,
and stared now at the mosquito net, now at Jose as he lay there by the door. Then he
continued with his letter.
"This boy, Jose, compadre,"he went on, "is quite an industrious lad. If you can only let
him stay in your big house. Compadre, you can make him do anything you wish-any work.
He can cook rice, and I'm sure he'll do well washing dishes."
Julio recalled his last visit to ka Ponso's about three months ago, during the fiesta.
he had seen that it was a big house with many servants; the floor was so polished you
could almost see your own image under your feet as you walked; and always there was a
servant who followed you about with a piece of rag to wipe away the smudges of dirt which
your feet had left on the floor.
"I hope you will not think of his as great bother. "Julio continued, trying his best to
phrase these thoughts. He had a vague far that ka Ponso might not favourably regard his
letter. But he wrote on, slowly and steadily, stopping only to read what he had put down.</h2><br />

into the forest.
Moral: If you keep lying, no one will believe you even if you are
speaking the truth. Always speak the truth.

                            17. The Two Brothers
Leo Tolstoy
Two brothers set out on a joumey together. At noon they lay out on a forest to rest. When they woke up they say
a stone lying next to them. There was something written on the stone, and they tried to make out what it was.
"Whoever finds this stone, let him go straight to the forest at sunrise. In the forest, a river will appear, let him swim
across the river to the other side. There he will see a she-bear and her cubs. Let him take the cubs from her and run
up the mountain with them, without looking back. On the top of the mountain, he will see a house, and in that house
he will find happiness."
When they had read what was written on the stone, the younger brother said: "Let us go together. We can swim
across the river, carry off the bear cubs, take them to the house on the mountain, and together they find happiness."
1 am not going into the forest after bear cubs," said the elder brother, "and I advise you not to go. In the first
place, no one can know whether what is written on this stone is the truth -perhaps it was written in jest... In the
second place, even if what is written here is the truth-suppose we go into the forest and night comes, and we cannot
find the river. We shall be lost. And if we do find the river, how are we going to swim across it? In the third place, even
if we swim across the river, do you think it is an easy thing to take her cubs away from a she-bear? She will seize us,
and instead of finding happiness, we shall perish and all for nothing. And, most of all, the stone does not tell us what
kind of happiness we should find in that house. It may be that the happiness awalting us there is not at all the sort of
happiness we would want."
The younger brother replied, "In my opinion, you are wrong. What is written on the stone could not have been
put there without reason. And it is all perfectly clear. In the first place, no harm will come to us if we try. In the second
place, if we do not go, someone else will read the inscription on the stone and find happiness, and we shall have lost
it all. In the third place, if you do not make an effort and try hard, nothing in the world will succeed. In the fourth place,
I should not want it thought that I was afraid of anything."
And so, the younger brother followed all the instructions on the stone. When he reached the top of the mountain
the people came out to take him to the city, where they made him their king. He ruled for five years, but in the sixth
year, another king waged war against him. The city was conquered, and he was driven out.
Again, the younger brother became a wandered, and he arrived one day at the house of the elder brother. The
brother was living in a village and had grown neither rich nor poor. The two brothers rejoiced at seeing each other, and
at once began telling of all that happened to them.
"You see," said the elder brother, "I was right. Here I have lived quietly and well, whole you, though you may have
been a king, have seen a great deal of trouble."
1 do not regret having gone into the forest and up the mountain," replied the younger brother. "I may have nothing
now, but I shall always have 
something to remember, while you have no memories at all."
