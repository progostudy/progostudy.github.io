                                            Activity 5. If you have successfully answered the above exercises, then you are ready for a more challenging one. ACCOUNTING SKILLS By Susan Jacobs I brought with me today some good news and some bad news. The good news is that if you were to open a CPA practice today, you could earn one thousand pesos an hour for your services. The bad news is that you would have to share that with each of your employees. If your business were successful and you had several clients that hourly fee could accumulate to quite a salary, even after deducting your employees' wages. I plan to be a CPA when I graduate from college. I have been working for five years on that degree and I feel that I know some of the skills and abilities that are needed to be a successful CPA. To be a successful accountant, you'll need some skills. I am going to tell you about some of those skills so that you can make sure you possess them when you're ready to start your career These skills are: (1) the ability to communicate, (2) the ability to use your knowledge, and (3) the ability to use computers. 	The most important skill we can possess as accountants is the ability to communicate on an interpersonal level. In a public practice, we will be dealing with clients of all kinds. In my interview with Keith Morrison, a CPA, I learned that our ability to communicate will determine our success or failure in the business world. How well we meet the demands and handle the problems of our clients will decide our fate. 	The communication demands that we will face in business will include oral communication with clients and written communication with certain agencies. In dealing with clients, we will speak with individuals about their tax returns and company representatives about their books. We will also spend time writing to various agencies, such as the Internal Revenue, the Tax Commission, regulatory agencies, and insurance agencies. According to Mr Morrison, the whole objective of the accounting process is to communicate information to the end user. If we can't do that, we're not going to succeed in accounting. 	One of the problems Mr. Morrison runs into is when a client comes in with a problem, but the client isn't sure what the problem is, or she or he isn't quite sure how to explain it We as accountants have to understand the problem before we can help the client. We must be good listeners so that we know which questions to ask By asking the right question, we can figure out the problem. We can waste a lot of time by failing to communicate effectively. The second most important skill is the ability to use the knowledge we have acquired while pursuing our accounting degrees. Mr. Morrison believes that we'll have the knowledge that we need from the courses we are required to take, but whether we can apply that knowledge will depend on our attitude. We must get training and experience in order to apply our knowledge and get the best results. The third most important skill we must have is the ability to use computers in our accounting capacity. A mere familiarity will not be enough. We must be able to deal with computers, function with them, be able to communicate with them in a sense, and be able to get along with them. Programming skills aren't essential, but they would be helpful. They would enable us to be more familiar with the computer. We must feel comfortable with computers and not be afraid of them. We must be able to combine our accounting knowledge with our computer knowledge to master the business application. In conclusion, there is more to being a successful accountant than obtaining a degree. We must be able to communicate with our clients on an interpersonal level. We must be able to get to the root of their problems, and we must be able to communicate to them the information they need whether orally or in writing. We must be able to apply the knowledge we've acquired while pursuing our degrees in order to get the best results from the training and experience we pick up along the way And we must have an understanding of computers and how they function in the business world so that we can combine our accounting with the computer and master the business applications. We must all want to be successful in our careers. We must sharpen our skills and make the most of our knowledge, and we will succeed.ilalagay kopo s taas yung pic ayun po yun dun sasagutan thank you po​</a>

                                            The Taximan's Story by Catherine Lim(Story taken from Embracing our Heritage, Learning Module for English Grade Spp168-169) Very good, Madam. Sure, will take you there in plenty good time for your meeting, madam. This way better, less traffic, less car jams. Half hour shouldmake it, madam, so not to worry.2 What is it you say, madam? Yes, yes, ha, ha, been taxi man for twenty years now, madam. Long time ago. Singapore not like this so crowded so busy. Last time more peaceful, not so much taximen, or so much cars and buses.3 Yes madam, can make a living. So so. What to do. Must work hard if wants to success in Singapore. People like us, no education, no capital for business, we must sweat to earn money for wife and children.Yes, madam, quite big family--eight children, six sons, two daughters. Big family! Ha! Ha! No good, madam. In those days. Where got Family Planning in Singapore? People born many, many children, every year, one child. Is no good at all. Today is much better. Two children, three children, enough, stop. Our government say stop.5 Luck for me, all my children big now. Four of my sons working one a businessman, two clerks, one a teacher in Primary school, one in National Service, one still schooling, in Secondary Two. My eldest daughter, she is twenty plus, stay at home, help the mother. No, not married yet---Very shy and her health not so good, but a good, and obedient girl. My other girl Oh, Madam! Very hard for father when daughter is no good and go against her parents. Very sad like punishment from God. Today, young people not like us when we are young. We obey. Our parents say don't do this, we never do. Otherwise, the cane. My father cane me. I was big enough to be married, and still, got caning. My father he was very strict, and that is good thing for parents to be strict. If not, young boys and girls become very useless. Do not want to study, but run away, and go to night clubs and take drugs and make love. You agree with me madam?6 Today, young people they are very trouble to their parents. Madam, you see this young people over there, outside the coffee house? See what I mean, madam? They are only school boys and school girls, but they act like big shots,Quarter 2 Week 5pending money, smoking, wearing latest fashion, and making love. Ah, Madam, I know, I know! As taximan, I know them and their habits. Madam, you are a teacher, you say? You know or not that young school girls, fifteen, sixteen years old, they go to public lavatory or hotel and change into these clothes, and they put make-up on their face. Their parents never know. They tell their Mum got school meeting, got sports and games, this, that, but they really come out and play the fool.​</a>

                                            I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed. Policies have to be put in place to ensure safe and ethical use of the internet. There are so many things that can happen these days with viruses and hackers. You definitely would not want to have a parent file a lawsuit on you or the school for inappropriate matter on the internet. Schools also have to implement technical assistance and skilled personnel that would help mentor, train, coach, and model how the technology works. Unfortunately, that is one area where teachers are at a loss. The training department for teachers is not what it should be. Teachers are constantly taking training courses that are more like daily workshops. Technology should be set up differently because of the many facets that it entails. Finally, teaching strategies are the key to success. Teachers have to find an accurate and efficient way to teach and assess their students. I believe that once a teacher has many of these things in place the classroom will be transformed into a new, more advanced classroom; A classroom that works with the teacher and for the students. It is easy to see how fast technology is growing. It is a decision of the schools to decide what kind of technology program to implement. It is the schools responsibility to stick with the plan and back that plan so that it has the best chance for success. The teacher’s role is a vital one while integrating technology. They are the ones that will be using, teaching, and assessing students. There are several resources available to teachers outside of the school. Teachers who really want a classroom integrated with technology will have to work for it. There is a place for technology in every classroom around the world no matter the size. Resources Cheska, M.

                            4. Activity 5. If you have successfully answered the above exercises, then you are ready for a more challenging one. ACCOUNTING SKILLS By Susan Jacobs I brought with me today some good news and some bad news. The good news is that if you were to open a CPA practice today, you could earn one thousand pesos an hour for your services. The bad news is that you would have to share that with each of your employees. If your business were successful and you had several clients that hourly fee could accumulate to quite a salary, even after deducting your employees' wages. I plan to be a CPA when I graduate from college. I have been working for five years on that degree and I feel that I know some of the skills and abilities that are needed to be a successful CPA. To be a successful accountant, you'll need some skills. I am going to tell you about some of those skills so that you can make sure you possess them when you're ready to start your career These skills are: (1) the ability to communicate, (2) the ability to use your knowledge, and (3) the ability to use computers. 	The most important skill we can possess as accountants is the ability to communicate on an interpersonal level. In a public practice, we will be dealing with clients of all kinds. In my interview with Keith Morrison, a CPA, I learned that our ability to communicate will determine our success or failure in the business world. How well we meet the demands and handle the problems of our clients will decide our fate. 	The communication demands that we will face in business will include oral communication with clients and written communication with certain agencies. In dealing with clients, we will speak with individuals about their tax returns and company representatives about their books. We will also spend time writing to various agencies, such as the Internal Revenue, the Tax Commission, regulatory agencies, and insurance agencies. According to Mr Morrison, the whole objective of the accounting process is to communicate information to the end user. If we can't do that, we're not going to succeed in accounting. 	One of the problems Mr. Morrison runs into is when a client comes in with a problem, but the client isn't sure what the problem is, or she or he isn't quite sure how to explain it We as accountants have to understand the problem before we can help the client. We must be good listeners so that we know which questions to ask By asking the right question, we can figure out the problem. We can waste a lot of time by failing to communicate effectively. The second most important skill is the ability to use the knowledge we have acquired while pursuing our accounting degrees. Mr. Morrison believes that we'll have the knowledge that we need from the courses we are required to take, but whether we can apply that knowledge will depend on our attitude. We must get training and experience in order to apply our knowledge and get the best results. The third most important skill we must have is the ability to use computers in our accounting capacity. A mere familiarity will not be enough. We must be able to deal with computers, function with them, be able to communicate with them in a sense, and be able to get along with them. Programming skills aren't essential, but they would be helpful. They would enable us to be more familiar with the computer. We must feel comfortable with computers and not be afraid of them. We must be able to combine our accounting knowledge with our computer knowledge to master the business application. In conclusion, there is more to being a successful accountant than obtaining a degree. We must be able to communicate with our clients on an interpersonal level. We must be able to get to the root of their problems, and we must be able to communicate to them the information they need whether orally or in writing. We must be able to apply the knowledge we've acquired while pursuing our degrees in order to get the best results from the training and experience we pick up along the way And we must have an understanding of computers and how they function in the business world so that we can combine our accounting with the computer and master the business applications. We must all want to be successful in our careers. We must sharpen our skills and make the most of our knowledge, and we will succeed.ilalagay kopo s taas yung pic ayun po yun dun sasagutan thank you po​</h2><br />

                            5. The Taximan's Story by Catherine Lim(Story taken from Embracing our Heritage, Learning Module for English Grade Spp168-169) Very good, Madam. Sure, will take you there in plenty good time for your meeting, madam. This way better, less traffic, less car jams. Half hour shouldmake it, madam, so not to worry.2 What is it you say, madam? Yes, yes, ha, ha, been taxi man for twenty years now, madam. Long time ago. Singapore not like this so crowded so busy. Last time more peaceful, not so much taximen, or so much cars and buses.3 Yes madam, can make a living. So so. What to do. Must work hard if wants to success in Singapore. People like us, no education, no capital for business, we must sweat to earn money for wife and children.Yes, madam, quite big family--eight children, six sons, two daughters. Big family! Ha! Ha! No good, madam. In those days. Where got Family Planning in Singapore? People born many, many children, every year, one child. Is no good at all. Today is much better. Two children, three children, enough, stop. Our government say stop.5 Luck for me, all my children big now. Four of my sons working one a businessman, two clerks, one a teacher in Primary school, one in National Service, one still schooling, in Secondary Two. My eldest daughter, she is twenty plus, stay at home, help the mother. No, not married yet---Very shy and her health not so good, but a good, and obedient girl. My other girl Oh, Madam! Very hard for father when daughter is no good and go against her parents. Very sad like punishment from God. Today, young people not like us when we are young. We obey. Our parents say don't do this, we never do. Otherwise, the cane. My father cane me. I was big enough to be married, and still, got caning. My father he was very strict, and that is good thing for parents to be strict. If not, young boys and girls become very useless. Do not want to study, but run away, and go to night clubs and take drugs and make love. You agree with me madam?6 Today, young people they are very trouble to their parents. Madam, you see this young people over there, outside the coffee house? See what I mean, madam? They are only school boys and school girls, but they act like big shots,Quarter 2 Week 5pending money, smoking, wearing latest fashion, and making love. Ah, Madam, I know, I know! As taximan, I know them and their habits. Madam, you are a teacher, you say? You know or not that young school girls, fifteen, sixteen years old, they go to public lavatory or hotel and change into these clothes, and they put make-up on their face. Their parents never know. They tell their Mum got school meeting, got sports and games, this, that, but they really come out and play the fool.​</h2><br />

                            6. I.Summarize the given text : Technology integration was the topic of this week’s chapter assignment. The chapter discussed two learning theories for a foundation to integration: Directed models and Constructivist models. The directed theory revolves around behavior and the processing of information. The constructivist theory deals with more of a “hands on” and social aspect approach. I would imagine most students at the early levels of learning are more visual and social learners taking more from experiences than a book. I guess it just depends on your beliefs and how you can best implement a strategy based upon your classroom. I personally feel that the classrooms in Piaget’s day were a lot less diverse than today’s. I think a teacher’s theory should be like a floating floor adjusting to its new room constantly. Integrating technology into a classroom can be very tedious and there are many things that teachers need to take under consideration. The (TIP) or Technology Integration Plan is a model that is used to “help teachers (especially those new to technology) plan for effective classroom uses of technology” (Roblyer &amp; Doering, 2010). I was pretty impressed with the model and how it went into detail with each of its phases. The phases are broken down easy with the teacher in mind. The first stage allows teachers to set learning goals for themselves. The next phase assists the teacher in deciding whether the lesson would be better with or without technology. I mean, it really breaks it down very well with each of its six stages. There is also a lot of information in books and online. I found a pretty cool article that discussed seven different ways teachers could integrate technology into the classroom. Create a clear vision of what a technological classroom looks like, build an on-campus and online learning network, and invest in yourself as a teacher. These are just a few things that will help in integrating technology into the classroom. The chapter discusses vital conditions to be present before and during integrating technology. Just as I have learned to create a clear vision of what a classroom integrated with technology looks like. It is also important to share your vision so that all levels of the school and district can properly plan for what will be needed.
