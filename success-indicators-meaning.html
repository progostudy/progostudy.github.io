                                            pa summary pounderstanding; and finally, a ‘community of practice' approach that centers on how students and teachers are absorbed into and become part of the academic practices for technical community. We propose three practical ways in which such a community approach within the assessment environment may be prompted and enhanced through the use of: social learning space, both physical and virtual; social learning, technical learning and collaborative assessment practices within developing student to enhance intelligence. Exploring the national student survey in TVL: Assessment and feedback issues The Higher Education Academy, Centre for Research into Quality of assessment, (2008) It asks all fulltime and part-time undergraduate students registered at participating institutions about their learning experiences during their final year of study by using to those technically sources it makes easier and faster. It has highlighted that students are notably less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments than about other aspects of their learning experience. In addition, Saxon, Levine-Brown and Boylan (2008) accurate assessment, effective academic advising, and appropriate placement are critical components of successful developmental education programs (Boylan, 2002; McCabe, 2000; Morante, 1989). Assessment is necessary in order to determine what student skills need to be developed. Advising is necessary to ensure that students know what assessment results mean and why they need to be placed in specific courses. Unfortunately, practically all assessment done in universities is cognitive. Comprehension assessment measures how much students may know about a particular subject at the time of testing. The results are usually reported as raw scores or percentiles indicating where students' skills fall along a continuum of all those on whom the comprehension assessment instrument has been norm. Although the information from such instruments is generally valid, reliable, and effective for placement, it does not address all of the factors that might contribute to student success. For instance, few efforts are made to assess students' affective characteristics such as motivation, attitudes toward learning, autonomy, or anxiety. According to a recent study by Gerlaugh, Thompson, Boylan, and Davis (2007), although almost all community colleges assess students' enlightenment skills, only 7% of them assess students' affective characteristics.​</a>

___1. Productivity is the output produced by a unit of factor input during a given span of time.
___2. The theory of production describes the functional relationships of output and economic resources, assuming these are of fixed size.
___3. Improvement in productivity can be seen if the ratio of output over input increases since a unit of input can produce more of the same output.
___4. A production function illustrates the varied combinations of inputs at the same level of plant capacity.
___5. Diseconomies of scale are the negative sloping portion of a long-run average cost curve.
___6. The Law of Diminishing Returns describes the tendency at some point for each succeeding addition to output to become smaller as the firms add succession units of variable input to some fixed inputs.
___7.An isoquant map contains infinite combinations of resource inputs that the same budget can purchase given constant prices.
___8. The AP and MP of a production function may shift downward or upward only because the overall productivity level of that firm may also change. Computers and computerized machineries are means of improving overall

____10. Returns to scale are the indicator of plant-size change of a given business firm.
___11. MRS measures the price of labor inputs over the price of capital outputs. 
___12. Output yielded from the last unit of input is marginal product.
___14. The quotient from dividing TP by the number of variable inputs is average product.

What Causes Truancy Among Grade 10 Students? TITLE The title should be descriptive, direct, accurate, appropriate, interesting, concise, precise, unique, and should not be misleading. Ex. Causes of Truancy Among Grade 10 Students PURPOSE - The goal or purpose of a research is to bring together different views, evidence and facts about a topic. Ex. This mini-research aims to know the causes why Grade 10 students are becoming truant. IMPORTANCE - A successful topic selection should reveal the goal orientation of the research, that is, what kind of goals the research should achieve. Ex. The results of this mini-research will help alleviate cases of truancy among Grade 10 students. This will assist school administrators, teachers and parents to think of ways on how students can improve academically and behaviorally as they will now be more motivated to come to school regularly. POPULATION AND SAMPLE - A population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about. A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from. Ex. The target population in this mini-research are the Junior High School students of Sindalan High School. However due to some constraints, only 40(computation on how to compute sample size was discussed) Grade 10 students will be considered as the sample selected randomly through systematic sampling (sampling methods) RESULTS - Data presentation obtained from accurate computations, through tabular or graphical methods with corresponding interpretations. CONCLUSION - Drawing conclusions refers to information that is implied or inferred. This means that the information is never clearly stated.

This involves the use of facts, figures, or quotes from experts to highlightthe writer's authority and make the arguments presented more convincing.2. These are questions that are not supposed to be answered. Instead, theyare asked for effect, to illustrate a point or let the reader think.3. This is done through the use of personal pronouns like you, your, we, our,and indicative words like together.4. The use of words that express modality or how likely something is going tohappen helps adjust the level of certainty of events to suit arguments.5. This involves the use of words that evoke emotions and make people feel acertain way.6. This means relying on expert advice from trusted people like doctors,scientists, and other professionals for things that the audience do not know.7. Commonly used in advertisements, this persuasion technique makes theaudience believe the idea that everyone is doing it" or that everyone likes something.8. This technique tries to link an object or an idea with something alreadyliked or desired by the target audience such as wealth, success, pleasure, and security.9.

                                            pa summary pounderstanding; and finally, a ‘community of practice' approach that centers on how students and teachers are absorbed into and become part of the academic practices for technical community. We propose three practical ways in which such a community approach within the assessment environment may be prompted and enhanced through the use of: social learning space, both physical and virtual; social learning, technical learning and collaborative assessment practices within developing student to enhance intelligence. Exploring the national student survey in TVL: Assessment and feedback issues The Higher Education Academy, Centre for Research into Quality of assessment, (2008) It asks all fulltime and part-time undergraduate students registered at participating institutions about their learning experiences during their final year of study by using to those technically sources it makes easier and faster. It has highlighted that students are notably less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments than about other aspects of their learning experience. In addition, Saxon, Levine-Brown and Boylan (2008) accurate assessment, effective academic advising, and appropriate placement are critical components of successful developmental education programs (Boylan, 2002; McCabe, 2000; Morante, 1989). Assessment is necessary in order to determine what student skills need to be developed. Advising is necessary to ensure that students know what assessment results mean and why they need to be placed in specific courses. Unfortunately, practically all assessment done in universities is cognitive. Comprehension assessment measures how much students may know about a particular subject at the time of testing. The results are usually reported as raw scores or percentiles indicating where students' skills fall along a continuum of all those on whom the comprehension assessment instrument has been norm. Although the information from such instruments is generally valid, reliable, and effective for placement, it does not address all of the factors that might contribute to student success. For instance, few efforts are made to assess students' affective characteristics such as motivation, attitudes toward learning, autonomy, or anxiety. According to a recent study by Gerlaugh, Thompson, Boylan, and Davis (2007), although almost all community colleges assess students' enlightenment skills, only 7% of them assess students' affective characteristics.​​</a>

                            7. pa summary pounderstanding; and finally, a ‘community of practice' approach that centers on how students and teachers are absorbed into and become part of the academic practices for technical community. We propose three practical ways in which such a community approach within the assessment environment may be prompted and enhanced through the use of: social learning space, both physical and virtual; social learning, technical learning and collaborative assessment practices within developing student to enhance intelligence. Exploring the national student survey in TVL: Assessment and feedback issues The Higher Education Academy, Centre for Research into Quality of assessment, (2008) It asks all fulltime and part-time undergraduate students registered at participating institutions about their learning experiences during their final year of study by using to those technically sources it makes easier and faster. It has highlighted that students are notably less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments than about other aspects of their learning experience. In addition, Saxon, Levine-Brown and Boylan (2008) accurate assessment, effective academic advising, and appropriate placement are critical components of successful developmental education programs (Boylan, 2002; McCabe, 2000; Morante, 1989). Assessment is necessary in order to determine what student skills need to be developed. Advising is necessary to ensure that students know what assessment results mean and why they need to be placed in specific courses. Unfortunately, practically all assessment done in universities is cognitive. Comprehension assessment measures how much students may know about a particular subject at the time of testing. The results are usually reported as raw scores or percentiles indicating where students' skills fall along a continuum of all those on whom the comprehension assessment instrument has been norm. Although the information from such instruments is generally valid, reliable, and effective for placement, it does not address all of the factors that might contribute to student success. For instance, few efforts are made to assess students' affective characteristics such as motivation, attitudes toward learning, autonomy, or anxiety. According to a recent study by Gerlaugh, Thompson, Boylan, and Davis (2007), although almost all community colleges assess students' enlightenment skills, only 7% of them assess students' affective characteristics.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This text discusses the importance of assessment in higher education and the need to move beyond cognitive assessments to include affective characteristics such as motivation and attitudes toward learning. It highlights the findings of a national student survey which indicates that students are less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments compared to other aspects of their learning experience. The text also proposes a "community of practice" approach to enhance assessment practices by using social learning spaces and collaborative assessment practices. The authors argue that assessment is critical for determining what skills students need to develop, and advising is necessary to ensure that students understand their assessment results and are placed in appropriate courses. However, the text notes that currently, only a small percentage of community colleges assess students' affective characteristics.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This passage discusses the importance of assessment and feedback in education, specifically in technical and vocational learning environments. The authors propose a "community of practice" approach to assessment, which focuses on involving students and teachers in academic practices and enhancing collaborative assessment practices. The passage also highlights the results of the National Student Survey, which shows that students are less positive about assessment and feedback on their assignments compared to other aspects of their learning experience. The passage also emphasizes the importance of accurately assessing student skills and affective characteristics such as motivation, attitudes, and anxiety, and suggests that universities should focus more on assessing these factors in addition to cognitive skills.</p><br />

                            24. 1. What is meant by the term reaction rate? 2. Name the factors that can affect the rate of a chemical reaction. 3. Label the graph. Indicate the reactants, products, transition state, activation energy, ΔH. For numbers 4 to 10, identify whether each statement is true or false. 4. If you compare two reactants with similar collision factors, the one with the larger activation energy will be faster. 5. Increasing the reaction temperature increases the percentage of successful collisions between reactants. 6. Exothermic reactions are faster than endothermic reactions. 7. If you double the temperature for a reaction, you cut the activation energy in half. 8. Collision frequency is the only factor affecting the rate of a chemical reaction. 9. Consider the reaction: N2O(g) N2(g) + O2(g). This reaction uses gold (Au) as a catalyst. The gold catalyst acts as a heterogeneous catalyst. 10. A catalyst increases the reaction rate by the same means as a rise in temperature.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The term reaction rate refers to the speed at which a chemical reaction occurs, measured by the change in concentration of reactants or products per unit time.</p><p></p><p>2.The factors that can affect the rate of a chemical reaction include:</p><p></p><p>Temperature</p><p>Concentration of reactants</p><p>Surface area of reactants</p><p>Pressure (for reactions involving gases)</p><p>Presence of a catalyst</p><p>Nature of reactants and their chemical properties</p><p></p><p>3The graph is not provided, so it cannot be labeled or described.</p><p></p><p>4.False. The activation energy is the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur, and a higher activation energy means that more energy is required for a reaction to proceed. Therefore, the reactant with the higher activation energy will be slower.</p><p></p><p>5.True. Increasing the reaction temperature increases the kinetic energy of reactant molecules, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions, and thus increasing the percentage of successful collisions.</p><p></p><p>6.False. The speed of a reaction is not determined solely by whether it is exothermic or endothermic. It depends on factors such as the activation energy and the concentration of reactants.</p><p></p><p>7.False. The activation energy is a constant for a given reaction and is independent of the temperature.</p><p></p><p>8.False. While collision frequency is an important factor affecting the rate of a chemical reaction, there are other factors, such as the energy of collisions and the orientation of colliding molecules, that also play a role.</p><p></p><p>9.True. A heterogeneous catalyst is one that is in a different phase (e.g., solid) from the reactants and works by providing a surface for the reaction to occur on.</p><p></p><p>10.False. A catalyst increases the reaction rate by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy, while an increase in temperature increases the kinetic energy of the reactant molecules, leading to more frequent and energetic collision.</p><br />
