                                            title Song:Where Is The Love Song by The Black Eyed Peas. What's wrong with the world, mama? People livin' like they ain't got no mamas I think the whole world's addicted to the drama Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism But we still got terrorists here livin' In the USA, the big CIA The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK But if you only have love for your own race Then you only leave space to discriminate And to discriminate only generates hate And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah. Madness is what you demonstrate And that's exactly how anger works and operates Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight Take control of your mind and meditate Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all People killin', people dyin' Children hurt, hear them cryin' Can you practice what you preach Or would you turn the other cheek? Father, Father, Father, help us Send some guidance from above 'Cause people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love (love) Where is the love? (The love) Where is the love? (The love) Where is the love, the love, the love? It just ain't the same, old ways have changed New days are strange, is the world insane? If love and peace are so strong Why are there pieces of love that don't belong? Nations droppin' bombs. Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones With ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone? So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug If f you never know truth then you never know love inte Where's the love, y'all, come on? (I don't know) Where's the truth, y'all, come on? (I don't Where's the love, y'all?

She would wake up every morning to prepare the meals we eat. She sweep our backyard and do household chores. We also do our best in helping her in any way. My mom also loves flowers and plants. She would take care of her plants to keep her busy during the Covid-19 pandemic. She always brought home new plants and flowers. But it's okay because that's what makes her happy. We all look up to our mom's in different ways and someday we will repay all the kind deeds they have done for us. Pls answer this! I am not joking!

When it feels all is lost
And you just want to run,
It can't rain forever.
Just wait for the sun.
When family is pain,
When friends can't be found,
When you just want to scream
But you can't find the sound,
When it's all your fault,
And you feel like you're done,
Just wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
The storm always passes.
It won't last forever.
The rain always stops and gives way to good weather.
The brightest and warmest of days still to come.
Please wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
People who need you,
People who still love you
Can warm up your soul like the sunshine above you.
You're never alone,
No matter what's done.
Wait for the sun.
Just wait for the sun.
Dark clouds always pass.
I promise you, hun.
We're all waiting with you.
Just wait for the sun.

                                            A Blind Man's Love A man married a beautiful girl. He loved her very much. One day she developed a skin disease. Slowly she started to lose her beauty. It so happened that one day her husband left for a tour. While returning he met with an accident and lost his eyesight. However, their married life continued as usual. But as days passed she lost her beauty gradually Blind husband did not know this and there was not any difference in their married life. He continued to love her and she also loved him very much. One day she died. Her death brought him a great sorrow. He finished all her last rites and wanted to leave that town. A man from behind called and said, "Now how will you be able to walk all alone? An these days your wife used to help you". He replied, I am not blind. I was acting because if she knew I could see her skin condition due to a disease, it would have pained her more than her disease. I didn't love her for her beauty alone, but I fell in love with her caring and loving nature. So I pretended to be blind. I only wanted to keep her happy". Moral: When you truly love someone, you will go to any extent to keep your loved one happy and sometimes it is good for us to act blind and ignore one another's short comings in order to be happy. The Beauty will fade with time, but heart and soul will always be the same. Love the person for what he/she is from inside, not from outside. What Did you feel after reading the story? Why did you feel that way ?​</a>

I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd
Need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were
Yeah, yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe; I need to feel you here with me
Yeah
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone

                                            Look at this home, we need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless but we'll get by just fine
Look at this family, a glowing constellation
So full of stars and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine, they burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more than just your gift
And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not some magic that you've got
The miracle is you, not some gift, just you
The miracle is you
All of you, all of you
Okay, so we gonna talk about Bruno? (That's Bruno)
Yeah, there's a lot to say about Bruno
I'll start, okay

That wasn't a prophecy, I could just see you were sweating
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
(Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?) Uh, But
Come into the light, the triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day
What's that sound? (Oh, oh)
I think it's everyone in town
Hey
Lay down your load (lay down your load)
We are only down the road (we are only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream when we work as a team (all of you, all of you)
You're so strong
Yeah, but sometimes I cry (all of you, all of you)
So do I
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go
The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you
Oh
Hey Mariano, why so blue?
I just have so much love inside
You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment, so would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you (and I hear you)
Yes (all of you, all of you)
Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn
You're the real gift, kid, let us in
Open your eyes
Abre los ojos
What do you see?
I see me
All of me</a>

I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd
Need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were
Yeah, yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe; I need to feel you here with me
Yeah
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you</a>

Madness is what you demonstrate And that's exactly how anger works and operates Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight Take control of your mind and meditate Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all People killin', people dyin' Children hurt, hear them cryin' Can you practice what you preach Or would you turn the other cheek? Father, Father, Father, help us Send some guidance from above 'Cause people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love (love) Where is the love? (The love) Where is the love? (The love) Where is the love, the love, the love? It just ain't the same, old ways have changed New days are strange, is the world insane?

'Cause you're the girl of my dreams
My prized possession
One and only
Adore ya
Girl, I want ya
The one I can't live without that's you, that's you

And you just want to run,
It can't rain forever.
Just wait for the sun.
When family is pain,
When friends can't be found,
When you just want to scream
But you can't find the sound,
When it's all your fault,
And you feel like you're done,
Just wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
The storm always passes.
It won't last forever.
The rain always stops and gives way to good weather.
The brightest and warmest of days still to come.
Please wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
People who need you,
People who still love you
Can warm up your soul like the sunshine above you.
You're never alone,
No matter what's done.
Wait for the sun.
Just wait for the sun.
Dark clouds always pass.
I promise you, hun.
We're all waiting with you.
Just wait for the sun.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>CONSTELLATION<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A <strong>constellation</strong> is a region on the divine circle where a gathering of noticeable stars frames an apparent framework or example, commonly addressing a creature, legendary individual or animal, or a lifeless thing.
</p><p>
</p><p>The beginnings of the most punctual <strong>constellations </strong>probably return to ancient times. Individuals utilized them to relate accounts of their convictions, encounters, creation, or folklore. Various societies and nations embraced their own <strong>constellations</strong>, some of which endured into the mid twentieth century before the present <strong>constellations </strong>were universally perceived. The acknowledgment of <strong>constellations</strong> has changed altogether after some time. Many changed in size or shape. Some became famous, just to drop into lack of definition. Some were restricted to a solitary culture or country.
</p><p>
</p><p>The 48 conventional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in Aratus' work Peculiarities and Ptolemy's Almagest, however their starting point presumably originates before these works by a few centuries. <strong>Constellations</strong> in the far southern sky were added from the fifteenth century until the mid-eighteenth century when European wayfarers started going toward the Southern Half of the globe. Twelve old <strong>constellations </strong>have a place with the zodiac. The beginnings of the zodiac remain generally dubious; its mysterious divisions became noticeable c. 400 BC in Babylonian or Chaldean cosmology.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What is a constellation? - Brainly.ph

                            23. A Blind Man's Love A man married a beautiful girl. He loved her very much. One day she developed a skin disease. Slowly she started to lose her beauty. It so happened that one day her husband left for a tour. While returning he met with an accident and lost his eyesight. However, their married life continued as usual. But as days passed she lost her beauty gradually Blind husband did not know this and there was not any difference in their married life. He continued to love her and she also loved him very much. One day she died. Her death brought him a great sorrow. He finished all her last rites and wanted to leave that town. A man from behind called and said, "Now how will you be able to walk all alone? An these days your wife used to help you". He replied, I am not blind. I was acting because if she knew I could see her skin condition due to a disease, it would have pained her more than her disease. I didn't love her for her beauty alone, but I fell in love with her caring and loving nature. So I pretended to be blind. I only wanted to keep her happy". Moral: When you truly love someone, you will go to any extent to keep your loved one happy and sometimes it is good for us to act blind and ignore one another's short comings in order to be happy. The Beauty will fade with time, but heart and soul will always be the same. Love the person for what he/she is from inside, not from outside. What Did you feel after reading the story?

                            26. Look at this home, we need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless but we'll get by just fine
Look at this family, a glowing constellation
So full of stars and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine, they burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more than just your gift
And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not some magic that you've got
The miracle is you, not some gift, just you
The miracle is you
All of you, all of you
Okay, so we gonna talk about Bruno? (That's Bruno)
Yeah, there's a lot to say about Bruno
I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry 'bout your wedding, didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy, I could just see you were sweating
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
(Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?) Uh, But
Come into the light, the triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day
What's that sound? (Oh, oh)
I think it's everyone in town
Hey
Lay down your load (lay down your load)
We are only down the road (we are only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream when we work as a team (all of you, all of you)
You're so strong
Yeah, but sometimes I cry (all of you, all of you)
So do I
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go
The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you
Oh
Hey Mariano, why so blue?
I just have so much love inside
You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment, so would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you (and I hear you)
Yes (all of you, all of you)
Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn
You're the real gift, kid, let us in
Open your eyes
Abre los ojos
What do you see?
I see me
All of me</h2><br />

                            29. Guess the song..
I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd
Need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you
We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were
Yeah, yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe; I need to feel you here with me
Yeah
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you</h2><br />
