The telephone rang and you learned that it is Mr. Chan calling from China. Funny thing though, even if you already know that Mr. Chan is in China, you could not help yourself look on the multi zone clock that indicates the time at different time zones across the world. Mr. Chiu wants to book two deluxe rooms for both of his family and friend on the 26th of December, so you booked him. You put the advance reservation card of Mr. Chiu in the reservation rack which is a special board or series of pigeonholes where cards are placed to show which room have been booked.​</a>

This can be used as a guide if you ever encounter a situation where you would need to provide counseling to another person 1. Building Rapport / Strengths Could you tell me some things about yourself? What do you enjoy doing? What are you good at? Describe what an awesome day would be like for you. What would the important people in your life say what is awesome about you? What do you enjoy learning about? 2. Goals How will you know that meeting here today was helpful? How would you know that coming here was worth your time? What do you hope to get out of visiting here today? What do you hope to see happen instead of what is bothering you? 3. Miracle Question If you could wave a magic wand and things changed, how would you know magic has happened? What would be different? What would you be doing differently that showed you your hopes came true? What else would be different? What other changes would you experience? Who would notice a change had happened? What would they see? 4. Exceptions to the Problem &amp; Competencies When are the times that "the problem is not such a problem? What is different? When does the problem" not bother you so much? How have you managed so far to deal with the problem" What has helped so far? Even if it has been just a little help. How have you found the courage to deal with this problem? 5. Scaling On a scale of 10 to 0, where 10 means your hope and goal has come true and O is the worst you can imagine, what number are you now? How will you know you have moved up one number? What will one number higher look like? How would you be able to move up one point? 6. Closure / Plan / What will you try differently or do more of when you leave today? What experiment can you try out? What is the best thing you noticed about yourself today?​​</a>

Sample Campaign Speech
"To my beloved constituents, I am your most trusted and humble
servant. I am standing in front of you to strengthen the connection that we
have. I have been your Municipal Mayor for two consecutive terms and we
have been proactively building our shared dreams together for the benefit
of the municipality. You have been my living witness of the different
incredible projects constructed and substantial ordinances crafted and
implemented. And not to mention my unending hard work in leading our
progressive municipality. Allow me to recall those days when a horrible
earthquake struck our place, when a disastrous flood took away lives of our
loved ones and when we fought together to deplete corrupt elected officials
who once led the municipality. We were together during those times. I could
not forget how we hand in hand elevated the lives and morale of each other.
We were together as one!
Now, allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude for your support and
love. They said that there is no such thing as forever. Let me correct them.
Here in our municipality, forever is real! I have no doubt that you will forever
believe in our teamwork.

Last year, the number of tourist arrivalsfor these four months (March to June), as per submitted hotel check-in data, was 517.107. Andconsidering a survey that says each tourist spends P2,700 per visit, per person, we can estimate thatP1.4 billion of potential gross tourist receipts did not come in this year. That amount could have beenwhat went to the salaries of employees and income of tourism businesses and their suppliers, spreadacross different sectors including the events, entertainment, and creative sectors.In a life-changing moment, the city that thrived and prospered as a popular tourist destinationis suddenly struggling. No tourists mean no business, no income, no livelihood. From accommodationestablishments alone, around 4,000 employees are affected and fearing possible retrenchment VictoryLiner, a tourism partner of North Luzon destinations, has already laid off 400 employees. In BurnhamPark, there are around 250 concessioners, aides, vendors, guides and photographers, who currentlyhave no source of income. According to DOT-CAR OIC Jovi Ganongan. 12 ESL (English as SecondLanguage) schools, now recognized as a growing tourism sector with foreign students as their market,had displaced 1,048 teachers and employees.The Baguio Tourism Council is conducting a survey that will assess the impact of thispandemic to tourism-oriented establishments. And so far, 33 businesses are saying that they will haveno other option but to shut down operations. One of our favorite home-grown restaurants, ForestHouse Bistro and Café, which closed recently, may just be the tip of the iceberg.Yes, the struggle is real. Employment, livelihood, and business revenue are at an all-time low.And the effect will trickle down to city revenue - no business means no taxes.

Should We Pay?     
Many issues have been plaguing the sports world recently, especially the question of paying college athletes. Are athletics so important that colleges need to put out millions of dollars per year just to pay for students to play for them? Paying college athletes is like throwing a lit match into a haystack: once the fire is started, it just keeps burning, making a bad situation worse.  There are several differences between the haystack and paying athletes. To start,  throwing a needle in a haystack is a totally negative concept; everything will burn. However, with paying college athletes, some people can find reasons why this could be a positive thing. For instance, some believe paying athletes will bring more competition to the table and make some colleges much more prestigious than others. Others say this will bring in more money and more revenue. A second difference is the end of the situation. At the end of the fire, there is smoke and it will eventually put itself out. However, this is an issue that cannot extinguish itself. No matter what the verdict, someone is going to be unhappy and the "fire" will keep burning.  Despite these differences there are many similarities between the two. One similarity is the haystack going up in flames and the whole educational system going up. If we pay our college athletes the focus will be more on the money than on learning.  College is supposed to prepare a student for life's work through learning, not be life's work. College sports will also become more like professional sports- all about the money and less about the love of the sport. Related to this is the issue of scholarships. Are scholarships not enough pay for the student? And who decides how much money each player receives? Will it depend on how good the player is, what sport they play, what position they are?  Another similarity has to deal with going up in flames. By throwing one little lit match into that haystack, the whole thing goes up. Just by paying college athletes many other issues arise. Yes, paying athletes may bring in more revenue, but how much of that will actually go back to the college or institution? Another issue that comes up is the fairness to other students. Young athletes already receive many things that non- athletes do not. Not only do they have the opportunity to travel and stay overnight in the best hotels, they also get special treatments away from the sport. Some athletes may receive special attention from certain professors or even people throughout the town in which the college is located.  A third similarity between the burning haystack and paying athletes is the rate at which things will "burn". The haystack will burn fast, leaving nothing behind, and getting bigger and bigger as it goes. The same goes for this issue. Everyone wants to voice their own opinion about it, snowballing into a bigger and bigger issue. People will quickly become angry and quick to defend their side.  Paying college athletes is like throwing a lit match into a haystack: the educational system and other issues go up in flames and they will occur very quickly. I believe there are more problems with this idea than there are good things about it. I find nothing about it to be worth spending millions of dollars to pay students to play a game. They need to be worrying more about their studies. This issue will be burning for a long time.

The technology I am talking about is modern conference call technology. Companies are spending a lot of money sending managers from one location to another to meet regularly with executives and also other managers. This is an extremely costly process. Not only do you have to consider the out of pocket costs of all that traveling, but you also need to consider the opportunity cost of those meetings as well. All of that time that these managers and executives are spending at airports, waiting in lines for rental cars, recovering lost luggage, checking into hotels, etc. could be time spent on business matters that provide value to the company. They could be looking over reports, managing employees or talking with customers. Wouldn’t you agree that these tasks are more beneficial than having that person away for a day or two while he is traveling? In case you haven’t caught up on things recently, there are ways that you can hold those meetings without taking your manager out of town, without wasting all that travel time and without wasting all of that money. You could start holding those less than vital meetings over the telephone or over the computer. The technology to do this has been around for a good long time, but it is still under-utilized. These teleconferencing services have improved dramatically over the years by using the internet as part of their service. You can collaborate on projects by showing power point presentations over the internet while you are conducting your meeting. You can even record the whole thing so that if one person was unable to attend the meeting, that person can view the meeting after the fact according to their own schedule. How is that compared to the system you are using right now? The other major advantage is the convenience of it all. If you need to schedule an emergency meeting to respond to some major event, this kind of service gives you that opportunity without having to book a bunch of last minute flights.</p><p></p><p><strong>// Hope this helped! //</strong></p>andhundreds morewhatyou monthlycontributeis almost overofshareoryun lng talaga makaya ko<br />

                            12. 1. The subtitle of "A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings" is "A Tale for Children". Do you believe this story should be read by children?

Why do you say so?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. It is ultimately up to the individual reader or parent to decide whether "A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings" is suitable for children. The story, written by Gabriel García Márquez, is a magical realism tale that deals with themes of faith, isolation, and the human condition. Some children may be able to appreciate and understand these themes, while others may find the story confusing or unsettling.</p><p></p><p>2. In the story, the old man is described as being very old and having enormous wings. He is covered in mud and has a "faint smell of burned feathers." He is weak and unable to fly, and he speaks a language that is incomprehensible to the people who find him.</p><p></p><p>3. Poverty does play a role in the story, as the family who takes the old man in is poor and struggling to make ends meet. They initially hope to profit from the old man's strange appearance, but their plans are thwarted when he fails to attract the attention and curiosity they had hoped for. If the family had been wealthy, it is possible that they may have had different motivations for taking the old man in, such as a sense of curiosity or a desire to help him. However, it is also possible that the old man's situation would have been the same regardless of the family's wealth, as his otherworldly nature and inability to communicate may have made it difficult for him to fit in or be understood by anyone.</p><p></p><p>4. Some possible themes of the story include isolation, faith, the human condition, and the dangers of greed and exploitation.</p><p></p><p>5. If I were the one to see the old man, I would likely feel a sense of compassion and try to help him in some way. Depending on the situation, this could involve providing food and shelter, trying to communicate with him, or seeking medical attention if he appeared to be injured or in need of care.</p><p></p><p>6. It is difficult to say for certain whether Elisande and Pelayo cared about the old man, as their actions and motivations are not fully described in the story. However, it is suggested that they are more interested in exploiting the old man for financial gain than in helping him or showing him compassion. For example, they initially hope to charge people to see the old man, and they later try to sell him to a circus. This suggests that they do not have the old man's well-being as their top priority.</p><br />

Sample Campaign Speech
"To my beloved constituents, I am your most trusted and humble
servant. I am standing in front of you to strengthen the connection that we
have. I have been your Municipal Mayor for two consecutive terms and we
have been proactively building our shared dreams together for the benefit
of the municipality. You have been my living witness of the different
incredible projects constructed and substantial ordinances crafted and
implemented. And not to mention my unending hard work in leading our
progressive municipality. Allow me to recall those days when a horrible
earthquake struck our place, when a disastrous flood took away lives of our
loved ones and when we fought together to deplete corrupt elected officials
who once led the municipality. We were together during those times. I could
not forget how we hand in hand elevated the lives and morale of each other.
We were together as one!
Now, allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude for your support and
love. They said that there is no such thing as forever. Let me correct them.
Here in our municipality, forever is real! I have no doubt that you will forever
believe in our teamwork.

Mapalo: The struggle is real: Depressing yet hopefulJuly 3, 2020 Sunstar Daily BaguioIt's been almost four months now since the government announced a national quarantineThese are supposed to be Baguio's peak season for tourists. Last year, the number of tourist arrivalsfor these four months (March to June), as per submitted hotel check-in data, was 517.107. Andconsidering a survey that says each tourist spends P2,700 per visit, per person, we can estimate thatP1.4 billion of potential gross tourist receipts did not come in this year. That amount could have beenwhat went to the salaries of employees and income of tourism businesses and their suppliers, spreadacross different sectors including the events, entertainment, and creative sectors.In a life-changing moment, the city that thrived and prospered as a popular tourist destinationis suddenly struggling. No tourists mean no business, no income, no livelihood. From accommodationestablishments alone, around 4,000 employees are affected and fearing possible retrenchment VictoryLiner, a tourism partner of North Luzon destinations, has already laid off 400 employees. In BurnhamPark, there are around 250 concessioners, aides, vendors, guides and photographers, who currentlyhave no source of income. According to DOT-CAR OIC Jovi Ganongan. 12 ESL (English as SecondLanguage) schools, now recognized as a growing tourism sector with foreign students as their market,had displaced 1,048 teachers and employees.The Baguio Tourism Council is conducting a survey that will assess the impact of thispandemic to tourism-oriented establishments. And so far, 33 businesses are saying that they will haveno other option but to shut down operations. One of our favorite home-grown restaurants, ForestHouse Bistro and Café, which closed recently, may just be the tip of the iceberg.Yes, the struggle is real. Employment, livelihood, and business revenue are at an all-time low.And the effect will trickle down to city revenue - no business means no taxes.

Should We Pay?     
Many issues have been plaguing the sports world recently, especially the question of paying college athletes. Are athletics so important that colleges need to put out millions of dollars per year just to pay for students to play for them? Paying college athletes is like throwing a lit match into a haystack: once the fire is started, it just keeps burning, making a bad situation worse.  There are several differences between the haystack and paying athletes. To start,  throwing a needle in a haystack is a totally negative concept; everything will burn. However, with paying college athletes, some people can find reasons why this could be a positive thing. For instance, some believe paying athletes will bring more competition to the table and make some colleges much more prestigious than others. Others say this will bring in more money and more revenue. A second difference is the end of the situation. At the end of the fire, there is smoke and it will eventually put itself out. However, this is an issue that cannot extinguish itself. No matter what the verdict, someone is going to be unhappy and the "fire" will keep burning.  Despite these differences there are many similarities between the two. One similarity is the haystack going up in flames and the whole educational system going up. If we pay our college athletes the focus will be more on the money than on learning.  College is supposed to prepare a student for life's work through learning, not be life's work. College sports will also become more like professional sports- all about the money and less about the love of the sport. Related to this is the issue of scholarships. Are scholarships not enough pay for the student? And who decides how much money each player receives? Will it depend on how good the player is, what sport they play, what position they are?  Another similarity has to deal with going up in flames. By throwing one little lit match into that haystack, the whole thing goes up. Just by paying college athletes many other issues arise. Yes, paying athletes may bring in more revenue, but how much of that will actually go back to the college or institution? Another issue that comes up is the fairness to other students. Young athletes already receive many things that non- athletes do not. Not only do they have the opportunity to travel and stay overnight in the best hotels, they also get special treatments away from the sport. Some athletes may receive special attention from certain professors or even people throughout the town in which the college is located.  A third similarity between the burning haystack and paying athletes is the rate at which things will "burn". The haystack will burn fast, leaving nothing behind, and getting bigger and bigger as it goes. The same goes for this issue. Everyone wants to voice their own opinion about it, snowballing into a bigger and bigger issue. People will quickly become angry and quick to defend their side.  Paying college athletes is like throwing a lit match into a haystack: the educational system and other issues go up in flames and they will occur very quickly. I believe there are more problems with this idea than there are good things about it. I find nothing about it to be worth spending millions of dollars to pay students to play a game. They need to be worrying more about their studies. This issue will be burning for a long time.
