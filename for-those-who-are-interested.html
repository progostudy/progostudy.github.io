You may list down persons who you think are consistent and independent. They are the person/s who you only met once and gave a little impact in your life in terms of beliefs, styles, and interests. Consistent and dependent are those who are with you all the time, are most common interests, and give big impact in your life. Who are these persors that you have encountered? You can list their names and tell something about then. What about those who are inconsistent in your life? Can you name them?​</a>
