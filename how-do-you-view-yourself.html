                        <p>In a rural community, you can see yourself as a member of a close-knit and interconnected community. You may also see yourself as someone who can contribute to the community's development, whether through volunteer work, supporting local businesses, or participating in community events. In terms of the five areas, you may see yourself as:</p><p></p><p>Physical: Engaging in outdoor activities such as farming, hiking, or gardening</p><p></p><p>Intellectual: Learning about rural issues, local history, and culture</p><p></p><p>Emotional: Developing relationships with members of the community and experiencing a sense of belonging</p><p></p><p>Social: Participating in community events, working collaboratively with others, and supporting local businesses</p><p></p><p>Spiritual: Connecting with nature, engaging in religious or spiritual practices, and finding meaning in the community's values and traditions.</p><p></p><p>Before immersion in a rural community, you may have held certain stereotypes or assumptions about rural life, such as it being boring or uneventful. However, after immersion, you may have gained a newfound appreciation for the community's way of life, its culture and traditions, and its unique challenges and opportunities. You may have also developed a stronger sense of empathy and understanding towards rural communities, their struggles, and their contributions to society. Overall, the immersion experience may have broadened your perspective and deepened your understanding of rural life.</p><br />

                        Hello. The answer is letter D.<p>i answered 2 incase you do not like letter c. please knw that my answer might not have answered the giude questions but you can always edit this.</p><p></p><p>c. gay
</p><p>
</p><p>i view the word gay as an identity of an individual. being gay is not entirely necessary, though, it kinda is since its an identity in my opinion. i believe that i do not know all things regarding homosexuality and is interested in knowing better-- including their rights and differences. the probable flaw in my statement is probably allowing 'gay' people. that is for the homophobic mindsent and those who are close-minded into the word of God. i am not telling you that the word of God is false, for i myself is a believer and a christian, although gay. the disciples who're close minded tend to stick to the idea that being gay is a sin because God only made 2 genders-- male and female. get the point there.
</p><p> i am probably bias because homosexual people are also humans but (most) doesn't experience human rights. they're always mocked and outcasted, and you'd find few people who accepts a homo as themselve without any grudge nor hate.  </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>e. new mode of learning
</p><p>the new normal mode of learning is, as we all know, online learning. it is where technology is included. as of today, i would say it is necessary because it's education. online learning is hard but is effective. those who can afford the studies might have thought "sayang ang taon." and pushed their child to study. this was the only solution the government thought of that is safe. some may say that the deped shouldve implemented 'academic freeze' because of the pressure and stress the students and the teachers are getting. many lives were taken because of this, too. many students have also stopped studying to help their parents, to sustain their everyday needs. online learning is way more expensive than f2f.  </p><p>i'd say i am not bias. i placed all the rational thoughts about the said topic-- including the good and the bad sides of it.</p><br />

                            27. Do you think that social media has a big role in how you view yourself physically, emotionally and socially? Why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social media has a big role in how I view myself physically, emotionally and socially.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This is because it gives us an idea of something that is ideal in our own personality. We go beyond what can be real and try to imitate them. This leads to the dissolve self, where we actualize something that we are not,thinking that we can be it or them. This illusion leads to the destruction of our psych which will later on be our anxiety that will cause our depression. </p><p>Remember that persons can be ideally perfect in the social media platform. The ugly ones can be made prettier. The evil ones can be made as good. The proportion of ones image can be repaired through different software. But mind you, this will not create the ideal you which is far beyond reality. If you really want to accomplish the ideal man, you must seek your identity from within and not from without.</p><p>For questions please comment below. Thanks.</p><br />
