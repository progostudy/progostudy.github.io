Somewhere Down the Road - Nina
We had the right love
At the wrong time
Guess I always knew inside
I wouldn't have you for a long time
Those dreams of yours
Are shining on distant shores
And if they're calling you away
I have no right to make you stay
But somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours
Will come to see
That you belong with me

                                            Why Houseplants are the Perfect Valentine's Day Gift
The Beatles sang “money can’t buy me love” but do you think they’d say the same thing about
houseplants and love?
If your partner or crush is a lover of all things green and leafy, then we bet they’d be thrilled
with getting a houseplant for Valentine’s Day. And even if they’re not a convert yet, now is a
good time to get them hooked to the plant gene. It’s early spring for most of us, and this is the
perfect time to bring a new houseplant home.
Sure, you can always default to red roses for a grand Valentine’s Day gesture, but let us try to
change your mind. Here's why houseplants make for much better gifts than cut flowers, plus
a few ideas of low-maintenance and romantic houseplants to get you started!
1.Houseplants last longer
Ok, this is obvious. But we’re trying to slowly ease into advocating for houseplants. The
average life of a bouquet of cut flowers is about a week. Some bouquets come with plant feed
that might stretch that to ten days. After that, it’s bye-bye flowers!
Houseplants last much longer. Even the blackest of thumbs can’t manage to kill a plant in a
week (don’t take that as a challenge though!). Houseplants may last for years as a good
reminder for a thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift.
2. Houseplants are often cheaper
We bet this one is not so obvious, right? You may think of houseplants as an investment. And
some of them are (especially rare specimens). But you can easily find houseplants that cost
10 dollars, and we’re not talking about runts. Prices are going down as the popularity of
houseplants is going up, so even a trip to your local plant nursery won’t break the bank.
3. Houseplants are more environmentally friendly
Most people don’t realize the environmental footprint of the fresh flower industry. That’s
because we tend to associate flowers with nature, and nature can do no wrong, right?
What I Can Do
21
Well, not until it’s exploited for profit at a massive scale. Most cut flowers are grown year-round
in greenhouses and fields heavily laden with pesticides. In the United States, most fresh
flowersare imported. And because the flowers are already cut (so pretty much dead), they are
shipped long distances in refrigerated containers that take a lot of energy to stay cool.
There is also a lot of waste in the flower industry because we all want perfect-looking flowers
with zero blemishes. And not to mention the waste caused by the flowers being thrown away
en-masse if the supermarket can’t sell them within the short window when they look nice and
perky. We’re not saying that houseplants have a zero-carbon footprint. But they are definitely
the more responsible choice for eco-conscious Valentines.
4. Houseplants send a message
Now that we got the practical reasons out of the way, let’s talk a bit about the sentimental
symbolism. When you give someone a houseplant, the underlying message is this: I think
you’re a responsible person. I think you can nurture and take care of something. And you can
count on me because I’ll be around to help. Maybe in not so many words. But the sentiment
is there!
If your partner is already someone who loves houseplants, then offering them another plant
for their collection shows that you care about their interests and hobbies. And you get extra
bonus points for being a good listener if they’ve already hinted that they wouldn’t mind another
green friend, and you deliver.

Choose your answers from the options provided inside the box. Write only the letter of your answer.A. Title E. Character LimelightB. Film Intro F. Likes and DislikesC. Plot Summary G. Lesson LearnedD. Setting Spotlight H. Recommendations1. The film was keen on details and it’s refreshing. This film deserves to be watched to inspire each and every one of us. If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2. Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3. “100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4. 90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5. Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6. Catharsis in Nostalgia by Abigail Eclavea7. It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardly present in mainstream cinema. “I love that there’s more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirable characters and the 2000’s vibes.”​</a>

                                            ACTIONS WHAT MUST BE DONE BEFORE THE ACTION?
1. Buying new clothes. 
*Buy the best you can afford. Cheap may get you through in the short term, but tends to fall apart, then you have to buy more and end up spending a lot anyway.
2. Choosing friends. 
*Earn the trust and love
3. Eating food. 
*Pick what you can only eat
4. Deciding where to study for Senior High School. 
*Plan
5. Attending classes in the afternoon. 
*Eating lunch-because it provides energy and nutrients to keep the body and brain working efficiently through the afternoon. Afternoon classes are fun and somewhat tiring as well.

                                            reflection in Speech of Her Excellency Corazon C. Aquino President of the Philippines During the Joint Session of the United States Congress [Delivered at Washington, D.C., on September 18, 1986] Three years ago, I left America in grief to bury my husband, Ninoy Aquino. I thought I had left it also to lay to rest his restless dream of Philippine freedom. Today, I have returned as the president of a free people. In burying Ninoy, a whole nation honored him. By that brave and selfless act of giving honor, a nation in shame recovered its own. A country that had lost faith in its future found it in a faithless and brazen act of murder. So in giving, we receive, in losing we find, and out of defeat, we snatched our victory. For the nation, Ninoy became the pleasing sacrifice that answered their prayers for freedom. For myself and our children, Ninoy was a loving husband and father. His loss, three times in our lives, was always a deep and painful one. Fourteen years ago this month was the first time we lost him. A president-turned-dictator, and traitor to his oath, suspended the Constitution and shut down the Congress that was much like this one before which I am honored to speak. He detained my husband along with thousands of others – senators, publishers and anyone who had spoken up for the democracy as its end drew near. But for Ninoy, a long and cruel ordeal was reserved. The dictator already knew that Ninoy was not a body merely to be imprisoned but a spirit he must break. For even as the dictatorship demolished one by one the institutions of democracy – the press, the Congress, the independence of the judiciary, the protection of the Bill of Rights – Ninoy kept their spirit alive in himself. The government sought to break him by indignities and terror. They locked him up in a tiny, nearly airless cell in a military camp in the north. They stripped him naked and held the threat of sudden midnight execution over his head. Ninoy held up manfully–all of it. I barely did as well. For 43 days, the authorities would not tell me what had happened to him. This was the first time my children and I felt we had lost him. When that didn’t work, they put him on trial for subversion, murder and a host of other crimes before a military commission. Ninoy challenged its authority and went on a fast. If he survived it, then, he felt, God intended him for another fate. We had lost him again. For nothing would hold him back from his determination to see his fast through to the end. He stopped only when it dawned on him that the government would keep his body alive after the fast had destroyed his brain. And so, with barely any life in his body, he called off the fast on the fortieth day. God meant him for other things, he felt. He did not know that an early death would still be his fate, that only the timing was wrong. At any time during his long ordeal, Ninoy could have made a separate peace with the dictatorship, as so many of his countrymen had done. But the spirit of democracy that inheres in our race and animates this chamber could not be allowed to die. He held out, in the loneliness of his cell and the frustration of exile, the democratic alternative to the insatiable greed and mindless cruelty of the right and the purging holocaust of the left. And then, we lost him, irrevocably and more painfully than in the past. The news came to us in Boston. It had to be after the three happiest years of our lives together. But his death was my country’s resurrection in the courage and faith by which alone they could be free again. The dictator had called him a nobody. Two million people threw aside their passivity and escorted him to his grave. And so began the revolution that has brought me to democracy’s most famous home, the Congress of the United States. The task had fallen on my shoulders to continue offering the democratic alternative to our people. Archibald Macleish had said that democracy must be defended by arms when it is attacked by arms and by truth when it is attacked by lies. He failed to say how it shall be won. I held fast to Ninoy’s conviction that it must be by the ways of democracy. I held out for participation in the 1984 election the dictatorship called, even if I knew it would be rigged. I was warned by the lawyers of the opposition that I ran the grave risk of legitimizing the foregone results of elections that were clearly going to be fraudulent. But I was not fighting for lawyers but for the people in whose intelligence I had implicit faith. By the exercise of democracy, even in a dictatorship, they would be prepared for democracy when it came. And then, also, it was the only way I knew by which we could measure our power even in the terms dictated by the dictatorship. The people vindicated me in an election shamefully marked by government thuggery and fraud. The opposition swept the elections, garnering a clear majority of the votes, even if they ended up, thanks to a corrupt Commission on E​</a>

                                            READ THIS SHORT STORY THEN ANSWER OF THE FOLLOWINGSTORYThere was a man that had 2 sons. The younger son told his father that he wanted his part of the inheritance. So the father divided what he had, and gave part to the son.A couple days later, the younger son packed up his belongings and traveled to a country far away.And he wasted what he had with extravagant living. He partied, spent time with women and wasted his money. After he had spent all the money that his father had given him, a severe famine came to the land. This means there was a food shortage, and now he doesn’t have money or food to take care of himself.He went to work for someone in that country and he was sent into the fields to feed the pigs. He was so hungry, he would have gladly eaten the pigs food, but no one gave him any food. He thought to himself…My father has servants, and they have bread to spare, and here I am hungry! He decided he would go home to his father and tell him: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.”  I’m not even worthy to be called your son! Make me one of your servants.He made the journey back to his father. When he was far away, his father saw him and had sympathy for him. His father ran and kissed him! He told his father that he has sinned and “I’m not worthy to be called your son.” BUT, the father told his servants to bring out the best robe and put it on him…put a ring on his hand…and sandals on his feet. He told them to bring the fatted calf and let us eat and be happy! My son was dead and now he is alive! He was lost and now he is found!But, the older son was in the field. As he came to the house, heard the music and asked a servant what was going on. He told him that his brother has returned home. He is safe and sound and your father is having a celebration.Well, he was angry. He wouldn’t go in the house. So his father came out to see him and pleaded with him. He told his father that he has stayed home and helped him and his father hasn’t ever had a celebration for him and his friends!But as soon as my brother comes back, who has wasted all his money, now you serve a great meal for him. His father told him that yes, he was always there for him, and everything that he had, would be his. But it is right to be happy, because his brother was dead, and is now alive. He was lost and now he is found.In this parable, Jesus is telling us that when we are sinners and are doing things with our money and friends that God doesn’t like it's like we have left Him, like the son that left home.We are lost, but when you decide to change your life, you go back to the Father, Who is God in heaven. You ask for forgiveness of what you did wrong. God is always happy when we come back to Him!Jesus loves us, and, He will welcome us just like the son was welcomed back home by his father.QUESTION.*If you are the lost or the prodigal one, what would you do to actually ask for forgiveness from your father and older brother?____________​</a>

Most of the time these discriminations are incorrect or have little meaning. For example, our habitual way of categorizing people as friends, enemies, and strangers depending on how they make us feel is both incorrect and a great obstacle to developing impartial love for all living beings. Rather than holding so tightly to our discriminations of the external world, it would be much more beneficial if we learned to discriminate between valuable and worthless states of mind.” - Geshe Kelsang Gyatso _____ 1.

First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials.

Somewhere Down the Road - Nina
We had the right love
At the wrong time
Guess I always knew inside
I wouldn't have you for a long time
Those dreams of yours
Are shining on distant shores
And if they're calling you away
I have no right to make you stay
But somewhere down the road
Our roads are gonna cross again
It doesn't really matter when
But somewhere down the road
I know that heart of yours
Will come to see
That you belong with me

                            4. Why Houseplants are the Perfect Valentine's Day Gift
The Beatles sang “money can’t buy me love” but do you think they’d say the same thing about
houseplants and love?
If your partner or crush is a lover of all things green and leafy, then we bet they’d be thrilled
with getting a houseplant for Valentine’s Day. And even if they’re not a convert yet, now is a
good time to get them hooked to the plant gene. It’s early spring for most of us, and this is the
perfect time to bring a new houseplant home.
Sure, you can always default to red roses for a grand Valentine’s Day gesture, but let us try to
change your mind. Here's why houseplants make for much better gifts than cut flowers, plus
a few ideas of low-maintenance and romantic houseplants to get you started!
1.Houseplants last longer
Ok, this is obvious. But we’re trying to slowly ease into advocating for houseplants. The
average life of a bouquet of cut flowers is about a week. Some bouquets come with plant feed
that might stretch that to ten days. After that, it’s bye-bye flowers!
Houseplants last much longer. Even the blackest of thumbs can’t manage to kill a plant in a
week (don’t take that as a challenge though!). Houseplants may last for years as a good
reminder for a thoughtful Valentine’s Day gift.
2. Houseplants are often cheaper
We bet this one is not so obvious, right? You may think of houseplants as an investment. And
some of them are (especially rare specimens). But you can easily find houseplants that cost
10 dollars, and we’re not talking about runts. Prices are going down as the popularity of
houseplants is going up, so even a trip to your local plant nursery won’t break the bank.
3. Houseplants are more environmentally friendly
Most people don’t realize the environmental footprint of the fresh flower industry. That’s
because we tend to associate flowers with nature, and nature can do no wrong, right?
What I Can Do
21
Well, not until it’s exploited for profit at a massive scale. Most cut flowers are grown year-round
in greenhouses and fields heavily laden with pesticides. In the United States, most fresh
flowersare imported. And because the flowers are already cut (so pretty much dead), they are
shipped long distances in refrigerated containers that take a lot of energy to stay cool.
There is also a lot of waste in the flower industry because we all want perfect-looking flowers
with zero blemishes. And not to mention the waste caused by the flowers being thrown away
en-masse if the supermarket can’t sell them within the short window when they look nice and
perky. We’re not saying that houseplants have a zero-carbon footprint. But they are definitely
the more responsible choice for eco-conscious Valentines.
4. Houseplants send a message
Now that we got the practical reasons out of the way, let’s talk a bit about the sentimental
symbolism. When you give someone a houseplant, the underlying message is this: I think
you’re a responsible person. I think you can nurture and take care of something. And you can
count on me because I’ll be around to help. Maybe in not so many words. But the sentiment
is there!
If your partner is already someone who loves houseplants, then offering them another plant
for their collection shows that you care about their interests and hobbies. And you get extra
bonus points for being a good listener if they’ve already hinted that they wouldn’t mind another
green friend, and you deliver.

Lesson LearnedD. Setting Spotlight H. Recommendations1. The film was keen on details and it’s refreshing. This film deserves to be watched to inspire each and every one of us. If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2. Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3. “100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4. 90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5. Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6. Catharsis in Nostalgia by Abigail Eclavea7. It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardly present in mainstream cinema. “I love that there’s more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirable characters and the 2000’s vibes.”​</h2><br />

                            8. reflection in Speech of Her Excellency Corazon C. Aquino President of the Philippines During the Joint Session of the United States Congress [Delivered at Washington, D.C., on September 18, 1986] Three years ago, I left America in grief to bury my husband, Ninoy Aquino. I thought I had left it also to lay to rest his restless dream of Philippine freedom. Today, I have returned as the president of a free people. In burying Ninoy, a whole nation honored him. By that brave and selfless act of giving honor, a nation in shame recovered its own. A country that had lost faith in its future found it in a faithless and brazen act of murder. So in giving, we receive, in losing we find, and out of defeat, we snatched our victory. For the nation, Ninoy became the pleasing sacrifice that answered their prayers for freedom. For myself and our children, Ninoy was a loving husband and father. His loss, three times in our lives, was always a deep and painful one. Fourteen years ago this month was the first time we lost him. A president-turned-dictator, and traitor to his oath, suspended the Constitution and shut down the Congress that was much like this one before which I am honored to speak. He detained my husband along with thousands of others – senators, publishers and anyone who had spoken up for the democracy as its end drew near. But for Ninoy, a long and cruel ordeal was reserved. The dictator already knew that Ninoy was not a body merely to be imprisoned but a spirit he must break. For even as the dictatorship demolished one by one the institutions of democracy – the press, the Congress, the independence of the judiciary, the protection of the Bill of Rights – Ninoy kept their spirit alive in himself. The government sought to break him by indignities and terror. They locked him up in a tiny, nearly airless cell in a military camp in the north. They stripped him naked and held the threat of sudden midnight execution over his head. Ninoy held up manfully–all of it. I barely did as well. For 43 days, the authorities would not tell me what had happened to him. This was the first time my children and I felt we had lost him. When that didn’t work, they put him on trial for subversion, murder and a host of other crimes before a military commission. Ninoy challenged its authority and went on a fast. If he survived it, then, he felt, God intended him for another fate. We had lost him again. For nothing would hold him back from his determination to see his fast through to the end. He stopped only when it dawned on him that the government would keep his body alive after the fast had destroyed his brain. And so, with barely any life in his body, he called off the fast on the fortieth day. God meant him for other things, he felt. He did not know that an early death would still be his fate, that only the timing was wrong. At any time during his long ordeal, Ninoy could have made a separate peace with the dictatorship, as so many of his countrymen had done. But the spirit of democracy that inheres in our race and animates this chamber could not be allowed to die. He held out, in the loneliness of his cell and the frustration of exile, the democratic alternative to the insatiable greed and mindless cruelty of the right and the purging holocaust of the left. And then, we lost him, irrevocably and more painfully than in the past. The news came to us in Boston. It had to be after the three happiest years of our lives together. But his death was my country’s resurrection in the courage and faith by which alone they could be free again. The dictator had called him a nobody. Two million people threw aside their passivity and escorted him to his grave. And so began the revolution that has brought me to democracy’s most famous home, the Congress of the United States. The task had fallen on my shoulders to continue offering the democratic alternative to our people. Archibald Macleish had said that democracy must be defended by arms when it is attacked by arms and by truth when it is attacked by lies. He failed to say how it shall be won. I held fast to Ninoy’s conviction that it must be by the ways of democracy. I held out for participation in the 1984 election the dictatorship called, even if I knew it would be rigged. I was warned by the lawyers of the opposition that I ran the grave risk of legitimizing the foregone results of elections that were clearly going to be fraudulent. But I was not fighting for lawyers but for the people in whose intelligence I had implicit faith. By the exercise of democracy, even in a dictatorship, they would be prepared for democracy when it came. And then, also, it was the only way I knew by which we could measure our power even in the terms dictated by the dictatorship. The people vindicated me in an election shamefully marked by government thuggery and fraud. The opposition swept the elections, garnering a clear majority of the votes, even if they ended up, thanks to a corrupt Commission on E​</h2><br />

                            9. READ THIS SHORT STORY THEN ANSWER OF THE FOLLOWINGSTORYThere was a man that had 2 sons. The younger son told his father that he wanted his part of the inheritance. So the father divided what he had, and gave part to the son.A couple days later, the younger son packed up his belongings and traveled to a country far away.And he wasted what he had with extravagant living. He partied, spent time with women and wasted his money. After he had spent all the money that his father had given him, a severe famine came to the land. This means there was a food shortage, and now he doesn’t have money or food to take care of himself.He went to work for someone in that country and he was sent into the fields to feed the pigs. He was so hungry, he would have gladly eaten the pigs food, but no one gave him any food. He thought to himself…My father has servants, and they have bread to spare, and here I am hungry! He decided he would go home to his father and tell him: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.”  I’m not even worthy to be called your son! Make me one of your servants.He made the journey back to his father. When he was far away, his father saw him and had sympathy for him. His father ran and kissed him! He told his father that he has sinned and “I’m not worthy to be called your son.” BUT, the father told his servants to bring out the best robe and put it on him…put a ring on his hand…and sandals on his feet. He told them to bring the fatted calf and let us eat and be happy! My son was dead and now he is alive! He was lost and now he is found!But, the older son was in the field. As he came to the house, heard the music and asked a servant what was going on. He told him that his brother has returned home. He is safe and sound and your father is having a celebration.Well, he was angry. He wouldn’t go in the house. So his father came out to see him and pleaded with him. He told his father that he has stayed home and helped him and his father hasn’t ever had a celebration for him and his friends!But as soon as my brother comes back, who has wasted all his money, now you serve a great meal for him. His father told him that yes, he was always there for him, and everything that he had, would be his. But it is right to be happy, because his brother was dead, and is now alive. He was lost and now he is found.In this parable, Jesus is telling us that when we are sinners and are doing things with our money and friends that God doesn’t like it's like we have left Him, like the son that left home.We are lost, but when you decide to change your life, you go back to the Father, Who is God in heaven.

                            10. “Normally we divide the external world into that which we consider to be good or valuable, bad or worthless, or neither. Most of the time these discriminations are incorrect or have little meaning. For example, our habitual way of categorizing people as friends, enemies, and strangers depending on how they make us feel is both incorrect and a great obstacle to developing impartial love for all living beings. Rather than holding so tightly to our discriminations of the external world, it would be much more beneficial if we learned to discriminate between valuable and worthless states of mind.” - Geshe Kelsang Gyatso _____ 1.

This spiritual work of mercy is based on fraternal correction which was observed by the early Christians 2. Jesus tells us, "But I shall see you again, then your hearts will rejoice with joy no one can take from you" (Jn 16-22) 3. A truly loving Christian Community needs people to be together for better or for worse 4. Bearing wrong patiently further includes wishing for the transformation of our wrongdoers 5.

If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2.Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey.
