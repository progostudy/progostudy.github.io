                                            Hard? You do not know what hard is, boy:
When I was your age, we got up in the pitch dark,
And walked five miles to school and ten miles back,
Uphill both ways and all we had for lunch
Was a cold sweet potato and dried fish.
And when we got back home, your grandma made us
Chop wood, feed the hogs, then milk the cows
Before supper, and all we had to eat
Was porridge and boiled cassava
Maybe some fried kangkong. Maybe some boiled eggs.
But what do you know? Shoot! you have always had
Hot fried chicken in front of you, like magic.
For you, it’s all ice cream and coke

Whenthey found it, and the dead thieves, they filled sixty great carts with the gold and took it backto the king. He said, "If those thieves had only put something back into the cupboard, theywould be alive this day."He ordered his servants to collect all the pieces of glass and melt them down andmake them into a globe with all the countries of the world upon it, to remind himself andothers, to give back something in return when someone or something does or gives ussomethingDirection: In five sentences write your own summary of the story.Summary:​</a>

The other two did the same and they too gotexactly what they wanted. The thieves forgot one thing. Not one of them put anything backin the cupboard.They went on and on for weeks and months. At last, the leader of the thieves couldbear it no longer. He took a hammer and smashed the glass cupboard into a million pieces,and then all three fell down dead.When the king returned home, he ordered his servants to search for the cupboard. Whenthey found it, and the dead thieves, they filled sixty great carts with the gold and took it backto the king. He said, "If those thieves had only put something back into the cupboard, theywould be alive this day."He ordered his servants to collect all the pieces of glass and melt them down andmake them into a globe with all the countries of the world upon it, to remind himself andothers, to give back something in return when someone or something does or gives ussomethingDirection: In five sentences write your own summary of the story.Summary:​</a>

Billy was always forgetting things. Every day, it was the same problem. On Monday, he forgot his homework, so he got in trouble from his teacher. On Tuesday, he forgot his school bag, so he had to carry all his things around in a plastic bag. On Wednesday, he forgot his sport's clothes, so he had to miss out on the sports lesson at school. On Thursday, he forgot his shoes, so he had to go to spend all day in barefoot, which is of course caused all the other kids to laugh at him. On Friday, he forgot his permission slip to go to the pool for swimming lessons, so he had to stay back and help the principal do jobs. Billy decided it was time to make a change. He was sick and tired of always forgetting things and getting into trouble and missing out on all the fun. He started writing notes and sticking them on the fridge everyday as soon as he got home from school, with all the things he needed to remember for the next day. Each morning, he checked the list and made sure he had everything he needed. It worked! From that day forward, Billy never forgot anything again. Until next Friday, of course, when he forgot to write on the note. Create two (2) sentences that makes connection between the text and your own life. 6. 7.

                                            DHARMA AWARENESSLucy was only ten when she started using drugs. Both of her parents were active addicts, so it was her mom who got her into it. Layla, her mother, always acted like a teenager, more like a friend than a mom, and she gave Lucy pills for the first time. Lucy was living with her back then and she started using consistently—taking a bunch of pills, smoking weed, and drinking liquors. The pills were her main thing. She struggled with depression and her parents' physical and verbal abuse, so then she started using drugs, cutting herself off and bringing guys in and out of her life. She started acting out like your typical teenage drug addict, stealing and sneaking out at night, but it was all pointless because her mother was high all the time and didn't even notice. If you were a friend of Lucy who has full awareness of the dharmas of Hinduism, how will you encourage, help and guide her to fulfill the following dharmas given below? Directions: Write your point or stand in a form of paragraph. One paragraph for each given dharma. Be thorough in your explanation.

                            3. Hard? You do not know what hard is, boy:
When I was your age, we got up in the pitch dark,
And walked five miles to school and ten miles back,
Uphill both ways and all we had for lunch
Was a cold sweet potato and dried fish.
And when we got back home, your grandma made us
Chop wood, feed the hogs, then milk the cows
Before supper, and all we had to eat
Was porridge and boiled cassava
Maybe some fried kangkong. Maybe some boiled eggs.
But what do you know? Shoot! you have always had
Hot fried chicken in front of you, like magic.
For you, it’s all ice cream and coke

                            11. DIRECTION: Read the story below and answer the questions that follow. LOST AND FOUND Billy was a lovely boy, but he had a big problem. Billy was always forgetting things. Every day, it was the same problem. On Monday, he forgot his homework, so he got in trouble from his teacher. On Tuesday, he forgot his school bag, so he had to carry all his things around in a plastic bag. On Wednesday, he forgot his sport's clothes, so he had to miss out on the sports lesson at school. On Thursday, he forgot his shoes, so he had to go to spend all day in barefoot, which is of course caused all the other kids to laugh at him. On Friday, he forgot his permission slip to go to the pool for swimming lessons, so he had to stay back and help the principal do jobs. Billy decided it was time to make a change. He was sick and tired of always forgetting things and getting into trouble and missing out on all the fun. He started writing notes and sticking them on the fridge everyday as soon as he got home from school, with all the things he needed to remember for the next day. Each morning, he checked the list and made sure he had everything he needed. It worked! From that day forward, Billy never forgot anything again. Until next Friday, of course, when he forgot to write on the note. Create two (2) sentences that makes connection between the text and your own life. 6. 7.

                            18. DHARMA AWARENESSLucy was only ten when she started using drugs. Both of her parents were active addicts, so it was her mom who got her into it. Layla, her mother, always acted like a teenager, more like a friend than a mom, and she gave Lucy pills for the first time. Lucy was living with her back then and she started using consistently—taking a bunch of pills, smoking weed, and drinking liquors. The pills were her main thing. She struggled with depression and her parents' physical and verbal abuse, so then she started using drugs, cutting herself off and bringing guys in and out of her life. She started acting out like your typical teenage drug addict, stealing and sneaking out at night, but it was all pointless because her mother was high all the time and didn't even notice. If you were a friend of Lucy who has full awareness of the dharmas of Hinduism, how will you encourage, help and guide her to fulfill the following dharmas given below?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Like Joseph, I am a forgetful person as well and it becomes a bad habit. I remember forgetting to remind myself to drink my medicine after eating every meals and it caused me much bigger problems. Not only forgetting to take my medicine was the biggest problem that I had but forgetting the necessary details that I had to do, like packing my lunch for school, doing the household chores, doing my assignment and other stuff caused me much bigger problems. I was taken as well to the hospital only to find out I had a leukemia which was the cause of my forgetfulness. A friend of mine recommended a book for me which is the Atomic Habits. After reading the book and savoring its context, I found myself changing my bad habits. For forgetting to take medicine, forgetting to do the laborious tasks I had to finally being able to do everything in to place just because of a simple book that taught me a lot in life. I have built a good habit in doing my tasks one step at a time by writing it on a sticky notes like what Joseph did, journaling, scheduling and organizing everything. </strong></p><p></p><br />
