As we say goodbye, we remind ourselves that farewells are not forever, nor are they the end. They are simply words to say that we will miss you dearly and that we will remember you fondly. Although we may be separated by time and distance in the interim, nothing will diminish the important role that you have and always will play in our lives. And so it is. and always will be with you as we carry you always close to our hearts. May the road rise up to meet you may the wind be ever at your back. And until we meet again, may God hold you in the hollow of his handThe Cohesive Devices used in the speech:_______________________________________________​</a>

                            2. Is it true that we should always follow our heart when making a decision? Justify your answer.​</h2><br />
                        <p>Yes we should follow our hearts when making a decision however we should also take our minds advise as well. Our heart tells us of our passion and our minds tells us what is practical. Depending on the situation, we should follow our heart to prevent any regrets since decisions leads to the path you are going to take where there is no turning back. To prevent any regrets you must follow your heart on what makes you really happy but as well as deliberate with your mind if it is what's really best for you and does not do you no harm in the future.</p><p>Yes. As psychology said, we need to always follow our hearts, you know why? Because if we listen and trust yourselves including your heart, the heart has the pursue of feelings. Well to me, the pursue of feelings is like the heart is thinking by our associations and feelings. If we listen it right, we will always usually be right. We know the brain was making the decisions because the heart only pumps blood. But, if we make decisions logically or emotionally, we need to listen our heart. Well, heart was only sometimes feel emotions because brain makes emotions, learning, and thinking in ourselves. Well, heart has a communication with brain, that is why sometimes, the heart thinks and feel emotions because of this connection.</p><br />
