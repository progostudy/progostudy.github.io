                                            Dark chocolate finds its way into the best ice creams, biscuits and cakes. Although eating chocolate usually comes with a warning that it is fattening, it is also believed by some to have magical and medicinal effects. In fact, cacao trees are sometimes called Theobroma cacao which means “food of the gods.” Dark chocolate has been found out to be helpful in small quantities. One of its benefits is that it has some of the most important minerals and vitamins that people need. It has antioxidants that help protect the heart. Another important benefit is that the fat content of chocolate does not raise the level of cholesterol in the blood stream. A third benefit is that it helps address respiratory problems. Also, it has been found out to help ease coughs and respiratory concerns. Finally, chocolate increases serotonin levels in the brain. This is what gives us a feeling of well-being.

                                            (story ↓)           (question↑)Dark chocolate finds its way into the best ice creams, biscuits and cakes. Although eating chocolate usually comes with a warning that it is fattening, it is also believed by some to have magical and medicinal effects. In fact, cacao trees are sometimes called Theobroma cacao which means "food of the gods." Dark chocolate has been found out to be helpful in small quantities. One of its benefits is that it has some of the most important minerals and vitamins that people need. It has antioxidants that help protect the heart. Another important benefit is that the fat content of chocolate does not raise the level of cholesterol in the blood stream. A third benefit is that it helps address respiratory problems. Also, it has been found out to help ease coughs and respiratory concerns. Finally, chocolate increases serotonin levels in the brain. This is what gives us a feeling of well-being.answer correctly please I need it for my module :D​</a>

                            12. Give your own meaning/opinion in regards with the statement below by Dr. Josette T. Biyo for a minimum of three sentences. Teaching may not be a lucrative position. It cannot guarantee financial security. It even means investing your personal time, energy, and resources. Sometimes it means disappointments, heartaches, and pain. But touching the hearts of people and opening the minds of children can give you joy and contentment which money could not buy. These are the moments I teach for. These are the moments I live for. - Dr. Josette T. Biyo​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Dr. Josette T. Biyo's statement highlights the importance of passion and fulfillment in the field of teaching. It acknowledges that the profession may not offer financial stability, but instead offers intangible rewards such as the joy of positively impacting the lives of students. The statement emphasizes that teaching is not just a job but a calling, and the satisfaction of making a difference in the lives of others is what makes it worthwhile. In my opinion, this statement reflects the true essence of teaching as a selfless act of service and dedication to shaping the future generation. It also shows that the true reward of being a teacher is the joy of seeing students grow and succeed, which is something that money can never buy.</p><br />

Although eating chocolate usually comes with a warning that it is fattening, it is also believed by some to have magical and medicinal effects. In fact, cacao trees are sometimes called Theobroma cacao which means "food of the gods." Dark chocolate has been found out to be helpful in small quantities. One of its benefits is that it has some of the most important minerals and vitamins that people need. It has antioxidants that help protect the heart. Another important benefit is that the fat content of chocolate does not raise the level of cholesterol in the blood stream. A third benefit is that it helps address respiratory problems. Also, it has been found out to help ease coughs and respiratory concerns. Finally, chocolate increases serotonin levels in the brain.
