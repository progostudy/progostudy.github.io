This is Tom Atom. Do you know how me, and my particles were discovered? Do you want to go with me back in time? Come! Ride with me in the time machine. A Journey to the Past Our first stop is in Abdera, Greece about 440 B.C. During this time, a Greek Philosopher named Democritus of Abdera (460 BC-370B.C.), speculated that a point would be reached where matter could not be further divided. He called this indestructible particles "atomos”- a Greek word meaning "indivisible". Democritus Moving forward, in 1897, Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940), discovered the electron in his Cathode Ray Experiment. He introduced Thoms electrons to the atomic model. His proposed model of the atom shows Joseph John Thomson negatively charged electrons stuffed like plums in a pudding of positive charges, now known as the plum pudding model. Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) accidentally discovered the proton and the nucleus in 1911 when he conducted the Gold Foil Experiment. He coined the word 'proton' for the minute unit of positive charge in the nucleus. The discovery of the proton led to James Chadwick Ernest Rutherford important developments in the study of elements. hero/www batannica.com ames Chadwick hrics/www.nobione przes/chemistr 1908 rutherforderphirar The discovery of the third fundamental particle in 1932 was credited to James Chadwick (1891-1974), a British Physicist. The elusive particle is called neutron. He was given the Nobel Prize for his discovery. Now that we are done with our journey, are you ready to do the next task?

A Glass Of Milk 
A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?." 
"You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart." 
Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness. 
Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. He recognized her at once. 
He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.

Do you know how me, and my particles were discovered? Do you want to go with me back in time? Come! Ride with me in the time machine. A Journey to the Past Our first stop is in Abdera, Greece about 440 B.C. During this time, a Greek Philosopher named Democritus of Abdera (460 BC-370B.C.), speculated that a point would be reached where matter could not be further divided. He called this indestructible particles "atomos”- a Greek word meaning "indivisible". Democritus Moving forward, in 1897, Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940), discovered the electron in his Cathode Ray Experiment. He introduced Thoms electrons to the atomic model. His proposed model of the atom shows Joseph John Thomson negatively charged electrons stuffed like plums in a pudding of positive charges, now known as the plum pudding model. Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) accidentally discovered the proton and the nucleus in 1911 when he conducted the Gold Foil Experiment. He coined the word 'proton' for the minute unit of positive charge in the nucleus. The discovery of the proton led to James Chadwick Ernest Rutherford important developments in the study of elements. hero/www batannica.com ames Chadwick hrics/www.nobione przes/chemistr 1908 rutherforderphirar The discovery of the third fundamental particle in 1932 was credited to James Chadwick (1891-1974), a British Physicist. The elusive particle is called neutron. He was given the Nobel Prize for his discovery. Now that we are done with our journey, are you ready to do the next task?

A Glass Of Milk 
A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?." 
"You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart." 
Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness. 
Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. He recognized her at once. 
He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.

                        Words That Reflects The Local Culture of An Asian Country<p></p><p><strong>→ You can see the table in the picture below.</strong></p>Further explanation:<p>The collective and varied customs and traditions of art, architecture, music, literature, lifestyle, philosophy, politics, and religion that have been observed and upheld by the different ethnic groups of the Asian continent throughout prehistory are collectively referred to as <strong>Asian culture</strong>. It is challenging to identify a particular Asian culture or universal components among the immense diversity that has emerged from many cultural fields and three of the four ancient River valley civilizations. The continent is typically split into six geographical sub-regions, each of which can be distinguished by observable similarities in things like culture, religion, language, and a degree of ethnic homogeneity. Central Asia, East Asia, North Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and West Asia are among these regions.</p><p></p><p>Asia is home to several of the world's earliest civilizations, which generated the majority of the main religious systems, the oldest known recorded mythologies, and the codices on<strong> ethics and morality.</strong> Asia is also the world's largest, most populous continent and is wealthy in resources.</p><p></p><p>But due to Asia's immense size, the numerous civilizations are spread across vast distances and inhospitable landscapes like deserts and mountain ranges.
