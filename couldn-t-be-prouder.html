After reading, evaluatethe short story using the criteria below. Then, Write a brief review in the comment section.Proud Little PencilBy Joemar L. Furigay"Pencils? They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</a>

                                            pleshActivity 1: Let's Identify!Directions: Read and analyze the texts that you are about to read. Then identify what writing technique is uded in each text.Text 1The idea of school uniforms seems like an outmoded concept for many students in the Philippines especially to those who studied in publicschools. Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China,in December 2019. On 30 January 2020, the Philippine Department of Health reportedthe first case of COVID-19 in the country with a 38-year-old female Chinese national.On 7 March, the first local transmission of COVID-19was confirmed. WHO is working closely with the Department of Health inresponding to the COVD419 outbreak.Text 3Education is the key to success as an old adage goes. A good education can teach a child how to learn and to have an independent learning. It may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why education is important in our society today. One of these is it helps people how to learn. It is not how the child accumulate knowledge either in the school or at home but how the child is taught to learn things differently. If the child has been taught how to learn,then he will bring such learning until he becomes an adult. Such learning will teach him to succeed in the future.If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and will be just a part of the curriculum. Without education, learning is hard to achieve.Now it's time to answer the following questions.1. What can you say about the texts that you have just read?2. What writing technique used from each of the given texts?3. How do these various writing techniques help you in your writing?​</a>

                                            2. A Miser had buried his gold in a secret place in his garden. Every day he went to the spot, dug up the treasure and counted it piece by piece to make sure it was all there. He made so many trips that a Thief, who had been observing him, guessed what it was the Miser had hidden, and one night quietly dug up the treasure and made off with it. When the Miser discovered his loss, he was overcome with grief and despair. He groaned and cried and tore his hair. A passerby heard his cries and asked what had happened. "My gold! O my gold!" cried the Miser, wildly, "someone has robbed mel" "Your gold! There in that hole? Why did you put it there? Why did you not keep it in the house where you could easily get it when you had to buy things?" "Buy!" screamed the Miser angrily. "Why, I never touched the gold. I couldn' think of spending any of it." The stranger picked up a large stone and threw it into the hole. "If that is th case," he said, "cover up that stone. It is worth just as much to you as th treasure you lost!" Summary:Pasagot naman po ng maayos thank u​</a>

After reading, evaluatethe short story using the criteria below. Then, Write a brief review in the comment section.Proud Little PencilBy Joemar L. Furigay"Pencils? They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</h2><br />

                            5. pleshActivity 1: Let's Identify!Directions: Read and analyze the texts that you are about to read. Then identify what writing technique is uded in each text.Text 1The idea of school uniforms seems like an outmoded concept for many students in the Philippines especially to those who studied in publicschools. Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China,in December 2019. On 30 January 2020, the Philippine Department of Health reportedthe first case of COVID-19 in the country with a 38-year-old female Chinese national.On 7 March, the first local transmission of COVID-19was confirmed. WHO is working closely with the Department of Health inresponding to the COVD419 outbreak.Text 3Education is the key to success as an old adage goes. A good education can teach a child how to learn and to have an independent learning. It may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why education is important in our society today. One of these is it helps people how to learn. It is not how the child accumulate knowledge either in the school or at home but how the child is taught to learn things differently. If the child has been taught how to learn,then he will bring such learning until he becomes an adult. Such learning will teach him to succeed in the future.If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and will be just a part of the curriculum. Without education, learning is hard to achieve.Now it's time to answer the following questions.1. What can you say about the texts that you have just read?2. What writing technique used from each of the given texts?3. How do these various writing techniques help you in your writing?​</h2><br />

                            10. 2. A Miser had buried his gold in a secret place in his garden. Every day he went to the spot, dug up the treasure and counted it piece by piece to make sure it was all there. He made so many trips that a Thief, who had been observing him, guessed what it was the Miser had hidden, and one night quietly dug up the treasure and made off with it. When the Miser discovered his loss, he was overcome with grief and despair. He groaned and cried and tore his hair. A passerby heard his cries and asked what had happened. "My gold! O my gold!" cried the Miser, wildly, "someone has robbed mel" "Your gold! There in that hole? Why did you put it there? Why did you not keep it in the house where you could easily get it when you had to buy things?" "Buy!" screamed the Miser angrily. "Why, I never touched the gold. I couldn' think of spending any of it." The stranger picked up a large stone and threw it into the hole. "If that is th case," he said, "cover up that stone.
