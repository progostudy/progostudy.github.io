Sample of Book Review:My Thoughts About Lullabies by Lang Leav (Book Review #85)Imagine reading a book that will literally lull you to sleep. This book is one of those.

One of the reasons why I believe, I didn’t find it hard to connect to her books is because of its use of language and writing style that even those who isn’t into poetry can enjoy. She writes poems concisely using simple but elaborate language that flows in it’s own rhythm. The book is thicker than the first one and features illustrations by Leav herself. The book has three parts: “Duet,” “Interlude” and “Finale” with illustrations accompanying each. The book has a wide array of romantic tales that a variety of people can definitely ​</a>

                            12.  "BOOKS"Those who cannot read are pitiful because they cannot enjoy books. Books tell us about the wonderful things in the world. They tell us about the interesting things people do. Books can answer the "whys" and "hows" of things that puzzle us. They can take us to faraway places through imagination. They can shows us, too, the things that happened a long time ago as well as those happening at present. Books tell us about the children in other lands. They hold the key to the greatest treasures in the world. A wise man once said that he would rather be a poor boy in a cellar surrounded with books than a prince  who had no chance to read.

Sample of Book Review:My Thoughts About Lullabies by Lang Leav (Book Review #85)Imagine reading a book that will literally lull you to sleep. This book is one of those. I am saying it in a god way though. Since it’s love month, I decided to delve into another Lang Leav book. Lullabies is Lang Leav’s second poetry book, with Love and Misadventure being the first one. I read, enjoyed and reviewed that book and made it to my list of the best books I enjoyed last year. I am not a fan of poems but Lang Leav’s works connected to me in a way that I find distinct. I didn’t find it hard to immerse and connect myself to her works which is my primary concern with other poem collections. Lullabies is a comforting read that provokes emotions. Using a familiar tone and style that he used in her first book, her new one offers a more in-depth discussion of the universal language that is spoken by the world, that is love. One of the reasons why I believe, I didn’t find it hard to connect to her books is because of its use of language and writing style that even those who isn’t into poetry can enjoy. She writes poems concisely using simple but elaborate language that flows in it’s own rhythm. The book is thicker than the first one and features illustrations by Leav herself. The book has three parts: “Duet,” “Interlude” and “Finale” with illustrations accompanying each. The book has a wide array of romantic tales that a variety of people can definitely ​</h2><br />
