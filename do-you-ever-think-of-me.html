                                            A Thousand Miles
Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way through the crowd
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight
It's always times like these
When I think of you
And wonder if you ever think of me
Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory
Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight
And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't
Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
Making a way through the crowd
And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, oh, oh
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you tonight</a>

                                            analysis of the following situation.I was 16 when I found out I was pregnant. I was scared, but deep down inside of me I felt a sense of happiness and hope. My parents and my boyfriend's parents all wanted me to have an abortion. Nobody supported me, and nobody asked me what I wanted to do. I felt as if I had no control or say in what happened. I resisted all the way to the clinic. I cried in the waiting room for almost six hours telling my parents how I did not want to have an abortion. My mom kept telling them to give me more drugs, and my dad kept telling me I had no choice, that this was not up to me. Over a year later I still cry every day. It has caused me so many emotional and mental problems. I have an eating disorder, depression, and now a drinking problem and fear of intimacy. I long for a child, and nothing will ever replace the baby that I had. NOTHING! If you think that you are pregnant and truly feel in your heart that you want to keep your baby, do not let ANYBODY, not your partner or even your parents, force or convince you that you should get an abortion. Abortions are not right, and you will not be quite right ever again if you get one. I know I never will be.</a>

And then some of you say that she isn't that "good".
They say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell everytime, you double crossed my mind; you said "if we had been closer in age maybe it would have it been fine" and that made me want to die. The idea you had of me who was she, a never needy ever lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you. Not weeping in a party bathroom, some actress asking me what happened YOU, that's what happened you.</a>

Ohh Balloons are deflatin'
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside
Like when you walked out my life
Why you walked out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?
No
(Ooh) No-no, no
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah
I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened 'til this day
I still see the messages you read, mmm
I'm foolishly patient
(Foolishly patient)
Can't get past the taste of your lips
(Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside
Like when you walked out my life
Why you walked out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?

Making a way through the crowd
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight
It's always times like these
When I think of you
And wonder if you ever think of me
Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong
Living in your precious memory
Cause I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight
And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't
Making my way downtown
Walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead, just making my way
Making a way through the crowd
And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, oh, oh
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by?
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles

                            6. analysis of the following situation.I was 16 when I found out I was pregnant. I was scared, but deep down inside of me I felt a sense of happiness and hope. My parents and my boyfriend's parents all wanted me to have an abortion. Nobody supported me, and nobody asked me what I wanted to do. I felt as if I had no control or say in what happened. I resisted all the way to the clinic. I cried in the waiting room for almost six hours telling my parents how I did not want to have an abortion. My mom kept telling them to give me more drugs, and my dad kept telling me I had no choice, that this was not up to me. Over a year later I still cry every day. It has caused me so many emotional and mental problems. I have an eating disorder, depression, and now a drinking problem and fear of intimacy. I long for a child, and nothing will ever replace the baby that I had. NOTHING! If you think that you are pregnant and truly feel in your heart that you want to keep your baby, do not let ANYBODY, not your partner or even your parents, force or convince you that you should get an abortion. Abortions are not right, and you will not be quite right ever again if you get one. I know I never will be.</h2><br />

                        <p>Noli Me Tangere is a novel about the past that currently is still present in today's society. Not only is it occuring in our own country but also in different societies of different countries. I believe that, yes, it can elicit a strong response in the Philippines. As a matter of fact, it already did many times, over and over again. In the past, this novel and the other novels written by Jose Rizal, was one of the reason as to why people revolutionized. Protesters wake up to being more truth-seekers because this book continues to exist. </p><br />

We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside
Like when you walked out my life
Why you walked out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?
No
(Ooh) No-no, no
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah
I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened 'til this day
I still see the messages you read, mmm
I'm foolishly patient
(Foolishly patient)
Can't get past the taste of your lips
(Taste of your lips)
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside
Like when you walked out my life
Why you walked out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary

On these days that feel like you and me

                        Over the past decades, our time is starting to get faster, and with that, the advancement of the Earth itself gets faster. I can still agree that the book can still hold a strong response to  children, but with the current children or the so called "Generation Z" (I'm part of it), have a more different mindset from what we used to be, thus making this piece of novel less and less relevant to our modern society.<br />

                        yes,because noli me tangere is a filipino novel by jose rizal which is about to the experience of the filippino back then by the hands of the japanese.Its a true to life story. and jose rizal write it so each filipino can relate and know what happends back then.<br /><strong></strong><br /><br />

                        As I read the story Noli me tangere I was impressed and at the same time I learned a lot although I only read was a summary.

                        1. Yes. ON THE DAY OF THE EXECUTION , Rizal, in a written declaration made by him on the day of his death, retracted all his writings and deeds and proclaims himself to be a repentant sinner and a loyal spaniard.<br /><br />2. The Spain-based newspapers and magazines that covered the retraction were El Imparcial, Heraldo de Madrid, and El Siglo Futuro. They based their narrative on the testimonies of the Jesuits and other colonial officials who visited and talked to Rizal the day before he was executed.<br /><br />3. There were four well-known reasons behind Rizal’s retraction First, He wanted to marry Josephine Bracken and to make her his wife legally. Second, He wanted to protect his family. Third, He wanted to reforms from the Spanish Government.<br /><br />4. This retraction has generally not affected Rizal's public image in the Philippines. Those believing in the Retraction hold that the letter redeems some of Rizal's anti-Catholic sentiments while those believing that the letter is a forgery view Rizal in a continuous heroic image.<br /><br />
