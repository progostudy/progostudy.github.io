                                            Passage 1
Back to the Future
 Heath had come clean. The way of life he had led until now couldn't satisfy him.
The day he decided to mend his mistakes was the day his mother said she still loved him.
Heath knew, no doubt, that his family was waiting for him to turn around. Even in the darkest
hours of the disappearance, Heath had not lost his faith in his family. Then, he had lost faith
in himself and had walked out in anger. Heath had become lonely for the love that he had
found smothering. After nights on the footpath, Heath knew what it took for his father to put a
roof over his head. Suddenly, it all made sense. Heath was himself again. He felt newer and
surer of himself like never before.
Passage 2
Not Drowning, but Waving
The day I almost drowned had saved my life.
I saw the world inside the waters' sphere.
Submerged I thought that I had lost it all,
and things had ended after one fateful fall.
But then, two hands reached for my shaky limbs.
I was pulled up; I made it to the shore.
I thank my life, more than I thanked before. 1. How are the archetypal settings in the poem and the story alike?

 The little sparrow heard the old woman shouting and called out sadly, "Oh, my I didn't know that it was your starch for it was in the bowl in which I usually get my dinner. I thought it was for me and I ate it all up."
1. What will happen next?
2. Why will it happen?
 At last the old woman said, "Alas it is growing dark. I must think about returning home. I haven't had such a good time in many years. Thank you!".
 The little sparrow was sad to see his kind master getting ready to leave and said, "I would like you to take a present home. "Then he hurried into another room and came back with two golden chests. "One chest is very, very heavy and the other is very light. which will you have?" asked the sparrow.
3. Which one will the old woman choose?
4. Why?
 She lowered the heavy chest to the ground and lifted the cover very carefully. She looked inside, expecting to see twice as many beautiful things as she had seen in the first chest but there wasn't a single jewel there. She screamed in terror when she saw what was in the chest it was filled with snakes and caterpillars, giant toads and poison spiders and a huge three-eyed monster. They slithered and slid around and began to crawl out over the sides.

                                            Love and TimeOnce upon a time all feelings and emotions went to a coastal island for a vacation.According to their nature, each was having a good time. Suddenly, warning of animpending storm was announced and everyone was advised to evacuate the island.The announcement caused sudden panic. All rushed to their boats. Even damagedboats were quickly repaired and commissioned for duty.Yet, Love did not wish to flee quickly. There was so much to do. But as the cloudsdarkened, Love realized it was time to leave. Alas, there were no boats to spare. Lovelooked around with hope.Just then Prosperity passed by in a luxurious boat. Love shouted, “Prosperity,could you please take me in your boat?”“No,” replied Prosperity, “my boat is full of precious possessions, gold and silver.There is no place for you.”A little later Vanity came by in a beautiful boat. Again, Love shouted, “Could youhelp me, Vanity? I am stranded and need a lift. Please take me with you.”Vanity responded haughtily, “No, I cannot take you with me. My boat will getsoiled with your muddy feet.”Sorrow passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was to noavail. “No, I cannot take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be by myself.”When Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help. ButHappiness was so happy that it did not look around, hardly concerned about anyone. Love was growing restless and dejected. Just then somebody called out, “ComeLove, I will take you with me.” It was an elder.Love did not know who was being so magnanimous, “Do you know who sogenerously gave me a lift just when no one else wished to help?”Knowledge smiled, “Oh, that was Time.”“And why would Time stop to pick me and take me to safety?” Love wondered.Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and replied, “Because only Time knows yourtrue greatness and what you are capable of. Only Love can bring peace and greathappiness in this world.”What is the plot of this po? Please answer. Thank you.​</a>

                                            My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in a
big family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.
One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a
nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do my
homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to
make them leave.
Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see
who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them
were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As
luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !
remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and
there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,
I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about
the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of
family
Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books
to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles
brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.
Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I
realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would
have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead
and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love
my family so much that I can't live without them.

A mother with four children was on the same bus. "Excuse me, may I take a seat because I have four children with me,” said the mother to the passengers. “Well, can't you see? The bus is already full,” replied one of the passengers. Sandra pitied the mother because there was no one on the bus that would let her sit or any of her children. "Mom, can I just sit on your lap?” asked Sandra to her mother. “But why Sandra?” asked Aling Rosa. “I have already paid our fare,” she added. “Look at them, Mama. I believe they might bump with each other and get hurt if they can't sit down,” explained Sandra. “In my opinion, the mother looks frail because of her age,” she added. “Alright my daughter, sit on my lap so that she could sit beside us,” said Aling Rosa, as she called the mother with four children. The mother thanked Aling Rosa and Sandra. Guide Questions: 1. Who are the characters in the story? 2. Describe each character. 3. What can you say about the story? " 7​</a>

He was very rich, and he loved gold and all the things that is fancy. But he loved his daughter more than anything. One day, Midas found a poor old man wandering in the streets barefoot, "Hello, You seem lost do you need help?" Midas asked the poor old man. "Yes i am, i have lost my track on my way home. Could you help me young man." The poor old man said. Midas let the poor old man go in his palace and let him stay there until His guards finds the poor old mans home. Midas gave the poor old man clothes, food , a place to stay in and anything the poor old man wants, Until 2 days later a guard found an old shack near the forest. "It must be the poor old mans house." The guard said. The guard come back to the palace and told the king, It was getting dark while midas was guiding the poor old man to his house, Until the poor old man turned into a genie. "Hello young man thank you very much for your good deed, I owe you a wish, wish anything you want young man and i will grant it for you." The genie said. Midas was shocked and gladly said his wish is that whatever he touch would turn into gold. Although the genie said "Are you sure young man?", Midas insisted that the wish was an excellent one, and it was granted! Excitedly, Midas went about touching all sorts of things, turning them into gold. Soon Midas became hungry. He picked up a piece of food, but he couldn't eat it, for it had turned to gold in his hand! "Oh no! My food turned into gold how am i going to eat this? I'm really hungry," said by Midas, "Perhaps this was'nt such a good wish after all!" Midas' beloved daughter, seeing his dismay, she tried to hug him to comfort him, and, she too turned to gold! "The golden touch is no blessing," cried Midas. He went to the river and wept begging to the genie to take his wish back." The genie said "Hello young man, why are you crying?"  "Please take my wish back! Take everything from me except for my beloved daughter! "Midas cried in tears "I see, now you've learned a valuable lesson today,That Gold cannot buy you happiness i can help you turned the things back into normal, Here take this magical potion spray it on the things that turned into gold and it will revert things to normal." The genie said. "Thank you!" Midas happily said in gratitude. And midas sprayed the magical water on everything he turned into gold including his daughter to revert things back to normal. "Now the king and his daughter is living happily ever after.1. what is the title of the story?2. what is the settings of the story?3. who are the characters in the story?4. what is the exposition of the story?5. what is the rising action of the story?6. what is the climax of the story?7. what is the falling action of the story?8. what is the resolution of the story.​</a>

                            11. My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in abig family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be anice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do myhomework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed tomake them leave.Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to seewho's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of themwere out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. Asluck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here andthere. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked aboutthe homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind offamilyMother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me booksto keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and unclesbrought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then Irealized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what wouldhave happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the foreheadand said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I lovemy family so much that I can't live without them.Activity 1Directions: Answer the following questions based from the story read. Use your English activity notebook.Guide Questions:1.

                            12. Passage 1
Back to the Future
 Heath had come clean. The way of life he had led until now couldn't satisfy him.
The day he decided to mend his mistakes was the day his mother said she still loved him.
Heath knew, no doubt, that his family was waiting for him to turn around. Even in the darkest
hours of the disappearance, Heath had not lost his faith in his family. Then, he had lost faith
in himself and had walked out in anger. Heath had become lonely for the love that he had
found smothering. After nights on the footpath, Heath knew what it took for his father to put a
roof over his head. Suddenly, it all made sense. Heath was himself again. He felt newer and
surer of himself like never before.
Passage 2
Not Drowning, but Waving
The day I almost drowned had saved my life.
I saw the world inside the waters' sphere.
Submerged I thought that I had lost it all,
and things had ended after one fateful fall.
But then, two hands reached for my shaky limbs.
I was pulled up; I made it to the shore.
I thank my life, more than I thanked before. 1. How are the archetypal settings in the poem and the story alike?

When the candle is lit, it melts and turns into a liquid, and the wick ignites, producing a <strong>flame </strong>that emits both light and heat. After the flame is put out, the candle cools down and solidifies again.<br /><br />When the candle is lit and melts, it is in a<strong> liquid state</strong>.<br /><br />The process that takes place when a solid-state change to a liquid state is called <strong>melting</strong>. This process involves adding energy, usually in the form of heat, to the solid, causing the particles to vibrate and break free from their fixed positions and arrange themselves in a more random manner characteristic of a <strong>liquid </strong>state.<br /><br />When a liquid state changes back to a solid, the process is called <strong>solidification </strong>or freezing. This process involves removing energy from the liquid, usually by cooling it down, causing the particles to slow down and arrange themselves in a more ordered, fixed pattern characteristic of a <strong>solid </strong>state.<p></p><p>If you want to know what is matter, please refer to this link: https://brainly.ph/question/473504<br /><br /></p><p><strong>#SPJ2</strong></p><br />

                            21. Love and TimeOnce upon a time all feelings and emotions went to a coastal island for a vacation.According to their nature, each was having a good time. Suddenly, warning of animpending storm was announced and everyone was advised to evacuate the island.The announcement caused sudden panic. All rushed to their boats. Even damagedboats were quickly repaired and commissioned for duty.Yet, Love did not wish to flee quickly. There was so much to do. But as the cloudsdarkened, Love realized it was time to leave. Alas, there were no boats to spare. Lovelooked around with hope.Just then Prosperity passed by in a luxurious boat. Love shouted, “Prosperity,could you please take me in your boat?”“No,” replied Prosperity, “my boat is full of precious possessions, gold and silver.There is no place for you.”A little later Vanity came by in a beautiful boat. Again, Love shouted, “Could youhelp me, Vanity? I am stranded and need a lift. Please take me with you.”Vanity responded haughtily, “No, I cannot take you with me. My boat will getsoiled with your muddy feet.”Sorrow passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was to noavail. “No, I cannot take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be by myself.”When Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help. ButHappiness was so happy that it did not look around, hardly concerned about anyone. Love was growing restless and dejected. Just then somebody called out, “ComeLove, I will take you with me.” It was an elder.Love did not know who was being so magnanimous, “Do you know who sogenerously gave me a lift just when no one else wished to help?”Knowledge smiled, “Oh, that was Time.”“And why would Time stop to pick me and take me to safety?” Love wondered.Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and replied, “Because only Time knows yourtrue greatness and what you are capable of. Only Love can bring peace and greathappiness in this world.”What is the plot of this po? Please answer. Thank you.​</h2><br />

"Excuse me, may I take a seat because I have four children with me,” said the mother to the passengers. “Well, can't you see? The bus is already full,” replied one of the passengers. Sandra pitied the mother because there was no one on the bus that would let her sit or any of her children. "Mom, can I just sit on your lap?” asked Sandra to her mother. “But why Sandra?” asked Aling Rosa. “I have already paid our fare,” she added. “Look at them, Mama. I believe they might bump with each other and get hurt if they can't sit down,” explained Sandra. “In my opinion, the mother looks frail because of her age,” she added. “Alright my daughter, sit on my lap so that she could sit beside us,” said Aling Rosa, as she called the mother with four children.

He was very rich, and he loved gold and all the things that is fancy. But he loved his daughter more than anything. One day, Midas found a poor old man wandering in the streets barefoot, "Hello, You seem lost do you need help?" Midas asked the poor old man. "Yes i am, i have lost my track on my way home. Could you help me young man." The poor old man said. Midas let the poor old man go in his palace and let him stay there until His guards finds the poor old mans home. Midas gave the poor old man clothes, food , a place to stay in and anything the poor old man wants, Until 2 days later a guard found an old shack near the forest. "It must be the poor old mans house." The guard said. The guard come back to the palace and told the king, It was getting dark while midas was guiding the poor old man to his house, Until the poor old man turned into a genie. "Hello young man thank you very much for your good deed, I owe you a wish, wish anything you want young man and i will grant it for you." The genie said. Midas was shocked and gladly said his wish is that whatever he touch would turn into gold. Although the genie said "Are you sure young man?", Midas insisted that the wish was an excellent one, and it was granted! Excitedly, Midas went about touching all sorts of things, turning them into gold. Soon Midas became hungry. He picked up a piece of food, but he couldn't eat it, for it had turned to gold in his hand! "Oh no! My food turned into gold how am i going to eat this? I'm really hungry," said by Midas, "Perhaps this was'nt such a good wish after all!" Midas' beloved daughter, seeing his dismay, she tried to hug him to comfort him, and, she too turned to gold! "The golden touch is no blessing," cried Midas. He went to the river and wept begging to the genie to take his wish back." The genie said "Hello young man, why are you crying?"  "Please take my wish back! Take everything from me except for my beloved daughter! "Midas cried in tears "I see, now you've learned a valuable lesson today,That Gold cannot buy you happiness i can help you turned the things back into normal, Here take this magical potion spray it on the things that turned into gold and it will revert things to normal." The genie said. "Thank you!" Midas happily said in gratitude. And midas sprayed the magical water on everything he turned into gold including his daughter to revert things back to normal. "Now the king and his daughter is living happily ever after.1. what is the title of the story?2. what is the settings of the story?3. who are the characters in the story?4. what is the exposition of the story?5. what is the rising action of the story?6. what is the climax of the story?7. what is the falling action of the story?8. what is the resolution of the story.​</h2><br />
