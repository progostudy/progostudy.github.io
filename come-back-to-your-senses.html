                                            The Man Who Can't Be Move
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

                                            Keep in Mind Suggested Time Allotment 10 minutes You have made decisions in the past and will be making still in the coming days, weeks or months. To be better on this, you may want to look back and reflect how you were doing it and be mindful on the learnings that those experiences try to mold in you. Did you have a moment of evaluating your decisions in the past? If so, how did you do it? Here are some pointers for you to make sense out of your past decisions: 1. Did you get the rightful results? Did it really solve your problem? If you answered "yes" to these questions, that's good. If "no", why did you say so? Did your solution create more problems or complications? If that's the case, then, you may take it as a learning experience. Maybe in your next decisions, you can check if your option will really answer the problem or it will create more. If it does, then, it certainly is not the right solution. You could consider other options next time and eliminate the choice that brought you more problems. 2. What were the consequences when you made that decision? What took place after your decision? Did it improve the situation? Did you feel good about it? Decision-making comes with responsibility. It is very ideal for any decision to be favorable for everyone. However, there are times that you need to calculate the risk of your choice. Hence, it has to be a well-calculated one. You are responsible for any decisions that you make. Good or bad, you have to own it. Be wiser with it. 3. Did it contribute to your personal growth in any areas of life (social relationship, academic performance, career pathing, health, spiritual, etc.) With your past decisions, can you identify any significant changes in your life in any aspect of it? For instance, when you decided to continue your studies during this pandemic, did it make a step nearer to your dream of finishing basic education? When you decided to stay at home instead of going out with your friends, did it make any difference to your safety? Try to appreciate whatever gains or personal development you have for any choice that you have. It is a good point of reference for your succeeding decision-making in life. 4. Did it consider the common good? In your past decisions, did it promote the welfare of everyone around you or there are regrets attached to it? There might be times when you are clouded by your personal biases or perceptions. However, the common good would always be a good consideration when weighing your options. At times, there is a need to analyze what is good for you and for everyone. Always try to check what would be good and gain for everyone. Your maturity and experiences aid you to always prioritize the common good. 5. How would that make you as a person?​</a>

Set down the mortars, line them up neatly.Girls of She Noun, take up the pestle-stone;
Then we sing Shwe Naung and chant it merrily in time,
As gracefully as we pound away.

Oh, lady of She Noun is giving alms,
With the music of drums and gongs.

There is a red-gold radiance over there;
Perhaps the sun has risen.
No, it's the dyed robes of the monks 
On their rounds with their begging bowls.
Come fill them with alms—food!

This Chricrkansia which i planted isn't it lovely? Tiny buds on slender stems
But if you pluck them before they flower,
My plant will wither away, you know.

Hey there , maiden at the loom,
What cloth are you wearing?
Oh, need you ask, in these thin times?
It's cotton coverlet for me.

I live in a house of teak,
Bright at night with torches,
It's true my parents are strict;
Yet if you dare to come yourself,
You can least send a letter.

The poor man is moping the house,
Feeling out of sorts and shaky
Because he's short of opium.
Very well,wry,
Sell my fine gold earplugs if you must,
But make sure you get a good price for them!

My handsome brother, a word with you
Before you leave for lower country;
If you find a wife there do not leave her;
Bring her to us, we've use her.
She can fetch us water, gather firewood,
Then i shall wear them.
9
I've both pair of sandals,
Such pretty red sandals,
But, i shan't wear them yet,
When you and I are truly wedded.

Write your answer in the box or write in another sheet of paper if necessary. Be guided by the rubric below. (10pts)
"The Story of an Hour" follows Louise Mallard, the protagonist, as she deals with the news that her husband, Brently Mallard, has died. Louise is informed of her husband's tragic death in a railroad accident by her sister, Josephine. Louise reacts with immediate grief and heads to her room where she gradually comes to the realization that she is happy that her husband has died. Though she bore no animosity towards her husband, the implications of his death include a new sense of freedom for Louise. This realization of possibility is the source of her joy and "she breathed a quick prayer that life might be long."
Later, she heads back downstairs, only to witness Brently coming home. Her joy turns to shock at the sight of her husband and she dies as a result. The doctors in the story diagnose her death as heart disease, also described as "of the joy that kills".</a>

We had a great time on the raft ndel The ride begins with a walk up a double flight of stairs. Then, riders wait until a raft comes up the conveyor belt. A lifeguard helps people onto the raft, Once the green light comes on, all it takes is push to get the raft sliding into the deep, dark tunnel. After sliding through a few twists and turns, the raft emerges back into the light and riders find themselves in a small pool - and ready to go again! 18. Dogs are often called as man's best friend. The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with best friendships, was fomed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. People are of great value to dogs too. Dogs that live with people usually have easier access to food and safer place to stay than they would their own, and that truly is what friends are for. 19.

Discourse
Directions: Read and understand the song. Then, answer the questions in the chart. (5 points)
Going back to the corner where I first saw you Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand I'm not broke I'm just a broken hearted man
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do How can I move on when I'm still in love with you
Chorus:
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving Policeman says son you can't stay here
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go
Repeat Chorus
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving. I'm not moving, I'm not moving People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl, oh whoa There are no holes in his shoes But a big hole in his world
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved. I'm the man who can't be moved
Repeat Chorus 2x
Going back to the corner where I first saw you. Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move.

After walking for three hours, Pedro said, “I am so tired 1.) _____ we sit for a few minutes? My feet are badly hurting, and I am so hungry.” Juan answered, “Of course, Pedro we 2.) _____.” But we 3.)_____ stay longer than ten minutes. It’s almost noon, and we 4.)_____ find our way back before sunset.” “Yes,” answered Jose. “Remember, we 5.)_____ stay here after sunset.

By five o’clock we 7.)_____ be in the place where we started, or else we 8.)_____ lose our waySo, the three decided to rest and eat their lunch. After a few minutes, the three started walking. “What’s that?” shouted Juan. “Is that a cave? Pedro looked at Jose and said, “Are you sure there is a cave in this forest?” Jose answered, “I have never heard of it. My grandfather never mentioned a cave in his stories.” But Juan responded, “It definitely is! Look, there’s the entrance. It’s covered by vines, leaves and “cadena de amor”. Surely no one has discovered it before.” Jose nodded his head in disbelief. But he said, “Let’s check our map, and find out if it does exist.” As he looked at the map, he found many marks, but not one indicated a cave. “No, there isn’t any cave found in the map.” “There is a lake, but no cave.” He folded the crumpled map and said, “I believe we 8.)_____ go back. There is something strange happening here.” As he started to walk, Juan answered. “Ooh! Where’s your sense of adventure Jose, I guess the cave was never discovered before. Why don’t we go inside and explore this unknown cave?” he added. Pedro nodded in agreement. “Why not? We 10.)_____ discover treasures. We will be rich, if that happens.” The two excitedly cleared the vines and leaves covering the entrance of the cave and walked inside, while Jose reluctantly followed them.The next day, a search party was called by the families of the three men. The teams searched the forest, but Jose, Pedro and Juan were never found. “We looked everywhere.” The rescuers told the families of the three, we e ven reached the lake, but we could not find them.” Not one among the members of the search party of forest rescuers mentioned about the existence of a cave.-The End.​</a>

We (5) are met on a great battle-field of that war. We havecome to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that thatnation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we cannot consecratewe cannot consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground.The (6.) brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to addor detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did(7) here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who (8) foughthere have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining beforeus that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last fullmeasure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not (9) have died in vain -- that thisnation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, forthe people, shall not perish from the (10) earth.Abraham LincolnNovember 19, 1863Perform Task​</a>

1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</a>

 A fox fell into a well and couldn’t get out. By and by a thirsty goat came along. Seeing the fox in the well it asked if the water was good. “good”, said the fox. “It’s the best water I’ve tasted in all my life. Come down and try it yourself. “The goat thought of nothing but how thirsty he was. So, he jumped into the well. When he had drunk enough, he looked around but there was no way to get out. Then the fox said, “I have a good idea. You stand on your hind legs and put your forelegs against the side of the well. Then I’ll climb on your back, from there I’ll step on your horns, and I can get out. And when I’m out, I’ll help you out of the well.” The goat did as he was asked, and the fox got on his back band so out of the well. Then he coolly walked away. The goat called out loudly after him out. The fox merely turned to him and said, “If you only have as much sense in your head as you have hairs in your beard you wouldn’t have jumped into the well without making sure that you can get out again.

                                            Study : Teenage brain lacks empathy By Sara Goudarzi If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)." Teen thinking In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'" Developing sensitivity Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.QUESTIONS:1. What does the author's use to get her point across?​</a>

                            10. The Man Who Can't Be Move
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, "If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?"
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke - I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl, oh ohh
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world, hmm
And maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

                            11. Keep in Mind Suggested Time Allotment 10 minutes You have made decisions in the past and will be making still in the coming days, weeks or months. To be better on this, you may want to look back and reflect how you were doing it and be mindful on the learnings that those experiences try to mold in you. Did you have a moment of evaluating your decisions in the past? If so, how did you do it? Here are some pointers for you to make sense out of your past decisions: 1. Did you get the rightful results? Did it really solve your problem? If you answered "yes" to these questions, that's good. If "no", why did you say so? Did your solution create more problems or complications? If that's the case, then, you may take it as a learning experience. Maybe in your next decisions, you can check if your option will really answer the problem or it will create more. If it does, then, it certainly is not the right solution. You could consider other options next time and eliminate the choice that brought you more problems. 2. What were the consequences when you made that decision? What took place after your decision? Did it improve the situation? Did you feel good about it? Decision-making comes with responsibility. It is very ideal for any decision to be favorable for everyone. However, there are times that you need to calculate the risk of your choice. Hence, it has to be a well-calculated one. You are responsible for any decisions that you make. Good or bad, you have to own it. Be wiser with it. 3. Did it contribute to your personal growth in any areas of life (social relationship, academic performance, career pathing, health, spiritual, etc.) With your past decisions, can you identify any significant changes in your life in any aspect of it? For instance, when you decided to continue your studies during this pandemic, did it make a step nearer to your dream of finishing basic education? When you decided to stay at home instead of going out with your friends, did it make any difference to your safety? Try to appreciate whatever gains or personal development you have for any choice that you have. It is a good point of reference for your succeeding decision-making in life. 4. Did it consider the common good? In your past decisions, did it promote the welfare of everyone around you or there are regrets attached to it? There might be times when you are clouded by your personal biases or perceptions. However, the common good would always be a good consideration when weighing your options. At times, there is a need to analyze what is good for you and for everyone. Always try to check what would be good and gain for everyone. Your maturity and experiences aid you to always prioritize the common good. 5. How would that make you as a person?​</h2><br />

Set down the mortars, line them up neatly.Girls of She Noun, take up the pestle-stone;
Then we sing Shwe Naung and chant it merrily in time,
As gracefully as we pound away.

What means that noise, that bustle we hear?
Oh, lady of She Noun is giving alms,
With the music of drums and gongs.

There is a red-gold radiance over there;
Perhaps the sun has risen.
No, it's the dyed robes of the monks 
On their rounds with their begging bowls.
Come fill them with alms—food!
4
This Chricrkansia which i planted isn't it lovely? Tiny buds on slender stems
But if you pluck them before they flower,
My plant will wither away, you know.
5
Hey there , maiden at the loom,
What cloth are you wearing?
Oh, need you ask, in these thin times?
It's cotton coverlet for me.
6
I live in a house of teak,
Bright at night with torches,
It's true my parents are strict;
Yet if you dare to come yourself,
You can least send a letter.
7
The poor man is moping the house,
Feeling out of sorts and shaky
Because he's short of opium.
Very well,wry,
Sell my fine gold earplugs if you must,
But make sure you get a good price for them!

My handsome brother, a word with you
Before you leave for lower country;
If you find a wife there do not leave her;
Bring her to us, we've use her.
She can fetch us water, gather firewood,
Then i shall wear them.
9
I've both pair of sandals,
Such pretty red sandals,
But, i shan't wear them yet,
When you and I are truly wedded.

"The Story of an Hour" follows Louise Mallard, the protagonist, as she deals with the news that her husband, Brently Mallard, has died. Louise is informed of her husband's tragic death in a railroad accident by her sister, Josephine. Louise reacts with immediate grief and heads to her room where she gradually comes to the realization that she is happy that her husband has died. Though she bore no animosity towards her husband, the implications of his death include a new sense of freedom for Louise. This realization of possibility is the source of her joy and "she breathed a quick prayer that life might be long."
Later, she heads back downstairs, only to witness Brently coming home. Her joy turns to shock at the sight of her husband and she dies as a result. The doctors in the story diagnose her death as heart disease, also described as "of the joy that kills".</h2><br />

We had a great time on the raft ndel The ride begins with a walk up a double flight of stairs. Then, riders wait until a raft comes up the conveyor belt. A lifeguard helps people onto the raft, Once the green light comes on, all it takes is push to get the raft sliding into the deep, dark tunnel. After sliding through a few twists and turns, the raft emerges back into the light and riders find themselves in a small pool - and ready to go again! 18. Dogs are often called as man's best friend. The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with best friendships, was fomed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. People are of great value to dogs too. Dogs that live with people usually have easier access to food and safer place to stay than they would their own, and that truly is what friends are for. 19. Writing names in a smooth bark can harm a tree. Diseases can attack the tree through the cuts in the bark. Trees can die because of these diseases. 20. Many children in the city go to school. They ride buses or jeepneys. Some ride in cars or taxis. Along the way, children see many people. They see many houses and tall buildings.

Discourse
Directions: Read and understand the song. Then, answer the questions in the chart. (5 points)
Going back to the corner where I first saw you Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand I'm not broke I'm just a broken hearted man
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do How can I move on when I'm still in love with you
Chorus:
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving Policeman says son you can't stay here
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go
Repeat Chorus
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving. I'm not moving, I'm not moving People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl, oh whoa There are no holes in his shoes But a big hole in his world
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner 'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved. I'm the man who can't be moved
Repeat Chorus 2x
Going back to the corner where I first saw you. Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move.

My feet are badly hurting, and I am so hungry.” Juan answered, “Of course, Pedro we 2.) _____.” But we 3.)_____ stay longer than ten minutes.

By five o’clock we 7.)_____ be in the place where we started, or else we 8.)_____ lose our waySo, the three decided to rest and eat their lunch. After a few minutes, the three started walking. “What’s that?” shouted Juan. “Is that a cave? Pedro looked at Jose and said, “Are you sure there is a cave in this forest?” Jose answered, “I have never heard of it. My grandfather never mentioned a cave in his stories.” But Juan responded, “It definitely is! Look, there’s the entrance. It’s covered by vines, leaves and “cadena de amor”. Surely no one has discovered it before.” Jose nodded his head in disbelief. But he said, “Let’s check our map, and find out if it does exist.” As he looked at the map, he found many marks, but not one indicated a cave. “No, there isn’t any cave found in the map.” “There is a lake, but no cave.” He folded the crumpled map and said, “I believe we 8.)_____ go back. There is something strange happening here.” As he started to walk, Juan answered. “Ooh! Where’s your sense of adventure Jose, I guess the cave was never discovered before. Why don’t we go inside and explore this unknown cave?” he added. Pedro nodded in agreement. “Why not? We 10.)_____ discover treasures. We will be rich, if that happens.” The two excitedly cleared the vines and leaves covering the entrance of the cave and walked inside, while Jose reluctantly followed them.The next day, a search party was called by the families of the three men. The teams searched the forest, but Jose, Pedro and Juan were never found. “We looked everywhere.” The rescuers told the families of the three, we e ven reached the lake, but we could not find them.” Not one among the members of the search party of forest rescuers mentioned about the existence of a cave.-The End.​</h2><br />

Compare and Contrast
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</h2><br />

 A fox fell into a well and couldn’t get out. By and by a thirsty goat came along. Seeing the fox in the well it asked if the water was good. “good”, said the fox. “It’s the best water I’ve tasted in all my life. Come down and try it yourself. “The goat thought of nothing but how thirsty he was. So, he jumped into the well. When he had drunk enough, he looked around but there was no way to get out. Then the fox said, “I have a good idea. You stand on your hind legs and put your forelegs against the side of the well. Then I’ll climb on your back, from there I’ll step on your horns, and I can get out. And when I’m out, I’ll help you out of the well.” The goat did as he was asked, and the fox got on his back band so out of the well. Then he coolly walked away. The goat called out loudly after him out. The fox merely turned to him and said, “If you only have as much sense in your head as you have hairs in your beard you wouldn’t have jumped into the well without making sure that you can get out again.

Distinguishable permutation involves the arrangement of objects where some objects may be identical, but they can still be distinguished from each other.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3. a. The number of permutations of n objects arranged (n-1) at a time is n!/(n-1)!</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>b. The number of permutations of n objects taken all at a time is n!.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>c. The two answers make sense because arranging n objects (n-1) at a time is the same as arranging all n objects and then removing one. Therefore, the number of permutations for n objects arranged (n-1) at a time is equal to the number of permutations of n objects taken all at a time divided by n.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4. In this case, since the order of the digits is unknown, we can use permutations to determine the number of possible combinations. The number of permutations of 4 digits taken all at a time is 4!, which is equal to 24. Therefore, there are 24 possible arrangements of the 4 digits, and we can try each one until we find the correct combination.</strong></p><br />

                            29. Study : Teenage brain lacks empathy By Sara Goudarzi If you ever sense teenagers are not taking your feelings into account, it's probably because they're just incapable of doing so. The area of the brain associated with higher-level thinking, empathy, and guilt is underused by teenagers, reports a new study. When considering an action, the teenage medial prefrontal cortex, located in front of the brain, doesn't get as much action as adults. "Thinking strategies change with age," said Sarah Jayne Blakemore of the University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. "As you get older you use more or less the same brain network to make decisions about your actions as you did when you were a teenager, but the crucial difference is that the distribution of that brain activity shifts from the back of the brain (when you are a teenager) to the front (when you are an adult)." Teen thinking In the study, teens and adults were asked how they would react to certain situations. As they responded, researchers imaged their brains. Although both adults and teens responded similarly to the questions, their brain activity differed. The medial prefrontal cortex was much more active in the adults than in the teens. However, the teenagers had much more activity in the superior temporal sulcus, the brain area involved in predicting future actions based on previous ones. Adults were also much faster at figuring out how their actions would affect themselves and other people. "We think that a teenager's judgment of what they would do in a given situation is driven by the simple question: 'What would I do?'" Blakemore said. "Adults, on the other hand, ask: 'What would I do, given how I would feel and given how the people around me would feel as a result of my actions?'" Developing sensitivity Children start taking into account other people's feelings around the age of five. But the ability develops well beyond this age, the new research suggests. And while some of this sensitivity could be the result of undeveloped regions in the brain, the experience that adults acquire from social interactions also plays an important role. My purpose in reading this: Reading Strategy I will use: 12 "Whatever the reasons, it is clear that teenagers are dealing with, not only massive hormonal shifts, but also substantial neural changes," Blakemore said. "These changes do not happen gradually and steadily between the ages of 0–18. They come on in great spurts and puberty is one of the most dramatic developmental stages." The results of the study were presented today at the BA Festival of Science in the UK.QUESTIONS:1. What does the author's use to get her point across?​</h2><br />
