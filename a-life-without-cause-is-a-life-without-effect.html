                                            Essay A (Argumentative Essay) Essay B (Inform GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memonizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole systern. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too​</a>

Explore Tsunamis! On December 26, 2004, a massive tsunami rose from the Indian Ocean. This tsunami was one of the most destructive natural disasters anyone had ever seen before. Where did these disastrous waves come from, and how was this tsunami able to hit so quickly without warning? There are several different situations that can cause a tsunami: underwater volcanic eruptions, meteor strikes, coastal landslides, and, most commonly, underwater earthquakes. A typical tsunami approaching land will slow down to speeds of 30 miles per hour as the wave grows to heights of up to 90 feet above sea level. A tsunami almost always promises flooding, destruction, and sometimes loss of life. Scientists have the equipment to detect underwater earthquakes just before a tsunami can hit the coast. However, because these giant waves form so quickly and hit coastal areas at hundreds of miles per hour, these detections often come too late. If you live near the coast, be aware of tsunami zones. Make sure your family has a plan in case you are caught near the wave.​</a>

The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too.Question: 1. what is the author's reason for writing? 2. what words or phrases prove your answer?3. which paragraph is the introduction?4. which part is the body of the essay?5. what does each paragraph contain? 6. which paragraph is the conclusion?7. which does the conclusion?​</a>

Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life.

                            12. Essay A (Argumentative Essay) Essay B (Inform GRADING by Remzi Yavuz As students we all have been challenged to do our best Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memonizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole systern. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too​</h2><br />

There are several different situations that can cause a tsunami: underwater volcanic eruptions, meteor strikes, coastal landslides, and, most commonly, underwater earthquakes.

A tsunami almost always promises flooding, destruction, and sometimes loss of life. Scientists have the equipment to detect underwater earthquakes just before a tsunami can hit the coast. However, because these giant waves form so quickly and hit coastal areas at hundreds of miles per hour, these detections often come too late. If you live near the coast, be aware of tsunami zones.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The author's reason for writing is to argue against the practice of grading students and to suggest that it is a flawed system that does not contribute to education.Phrases that prove this answer include "is it right to categorize students," "grading encourages learning and without it students would not study," "the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades," and "grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts."The introduction is not clearly marked, but the first paragraph can be considered the introduction as it introduces the topic of grading and its relationship to education.The body of the essay includes paragraphs 2-5, which provide arguments against the practice of grading students and the flaws of the grading system.Paragraph 1 introduces the topic, paragraph 2 argues that grading is based on fear and encourages cheating, paragraph 3 argues that grading focuses on memorization rather than true learning, paragraph 4 argues that grading creates inequalities and conflicts, and paragraph 5 suggests that the grading system cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul of the educational system.The conclusion is not clearly marked, but the last sentence of paragraph 5 can be considered the conclusion: "To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished."The conclusion summarizes the author's main arguments and suggests that education should not be based on conflict and competition. It also provides a clear thesis statement that grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Mark me Brainliest&lt;3<br />

What does the conclusion contain?                        Grading                 by Remzi Yavuz  As students we all have been challenged to do our best. Throughout our lives we have been labeled with our grades; in high school, the ones with low grades were left alone in misery, while the ones with higher grades were praised as the leaders of this horse race. Then, the question that comes into mind is: is it right to categorize students, does grading contribute to education? It is assumed and stated in the philosophy of the current educational system that grading encourages learning and without it students would not study. That is far from being true and also expresses another flaw of our education system. The system is based on fear the basic motive for students to study is fear of low grades. Furthermore, because the grades are the main criteria for passing courses, students do not study, they just develop methods of cheating. Thus, without learning the subject, they keep passing. Since grades received in exams are more important than learning the subject matter, all students have to do to pass their courses is memorizing how a specific problem is solved. Without knowing why such a method is used, students cannot apply their ability to solve the problem to daily life. However, they pass exams without learning why, how or what of the matter. Another disadvantage of grading is that grades of a student are not updated and will have a great impact in the long run. Apart from these problems, which can be virtually solved by optimizing and improving the grading system, the most important defect of the system cannot be repaired without changing the whole system. The grading system causes inequalities, superior-inferior relations, classifications, and even conflicts. It may be maintained that societies of the modern world are structured on these basic principles, but the fact that something exists does not justify it. Moreover, the people grown up in such an education system will not be able to see the other side of the walls, or will be afraid even to take a glimpse. To sum up, grading students is not a good practice and should be abolished. It is clear that education, especially education during childhood, has a great effect on one's life. And if you bring the children up in conditions of conflict and competition, they will look for conflicts in the future too.​</h2><br />
