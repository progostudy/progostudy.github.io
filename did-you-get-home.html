                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>5 BENEFITS OF GOOD VENTILATION SYSTEMS</p><p>There's no denying that fresh air is essential to humans - we need it to survive. In an ideal world, we would be constantly outside breathing in clean, pure air. Unfortunately, for many people, this is not the case. It’s likely that our jobs and the climate that we live in can determine that we will be spending a lot of our time indoors – which, in turn, provokes the need for a good ventilation system. So, what are the benefits of good ventilation systems?</p><p></p><p>WHAT IS VENTILATION?</p><p>First, it’s important to address what ‘ventilation’ means. Ventilation refers to the process by which ‘clean’ (normally outdoor) air is intentionally supplied to a space, while stale air is removed. There are various types of ventilation systems that can be used – such as air conditioning (including fan coils), air curtains, air recirculation and air infiltration.</p><p></p><p>Ventilation is especially required for commercial and industrial spaces to control indoor air quality by diluting and displacing indoor pollutants. Ventilation can also be used to control temperature, humidity and air motion.</p><p></p><p>WHY IS VENTILATION IMPORTANT?</p><p>Depending on your place of work, often we may need to spend a great deal of time indoors and in poorly ventilated spaces. If you’re spending a large amount of your working time in these spaces, this can be detrimental to our health. That’s why it is so important to have well-ventilated rooms both at home and in the workplace. </p><p></p><p>BENEFITS OF GOOD VENTILATION SYSTEMS</p><p>1. Control impurities</p><p>You may think that the air quality where you live isn't great, especially if you live in a bustling city centre, but in many cases, the air inside can be more polluted than the air outside. A good ventilation system will help expel a build-up of pollutants, bacteria, moisture and unpleasant odours, such as body odour.</p><p></p><p>2. Air regulation</p><p>Unless you have a good ventilation system in place, you have no control of the air flow in your building. Too much fresh air can mean costly energy bills, which is why good ventilation helps control the air, while regulating to the required health and safety levels. </p><p></p><p>3. Stop condensation</p><p>Condensation can lead to mould and rotten surfaces - which, naturally, is something you would want to avoid. Damp conditions and condensation can also cause health issues, such as allergic reactions and respiratory problems for many people. However, ensuring your company or organisation has good ventilation systems in place will help reduce these risks.</p><p></p><p>4. Reduce temperatures</p><p>When there are lots of people in a confined space, whether is for work, conference or a public event, the environment can soon become hot and stuffy. A well-ventilated room will instantly be more comfortable - creating a more relaxed environment, while also making for a more productive workplace.</p><p></p><p>5. Health benefits</p><p>Another benefit of good ventilation systems is the positive impact it as on health and well-being. Indoor air pollution coupled with bad ventilation can lead to a number of health problems including headaches, allergies, asthma, rashes and sinusitis. However, this can be avoided with the installation of a good ventilation system.</p><p></p><p>Ready to find the perfect ventilation system for you?

                        <p>If you find yourself lost in the forest, stay calm and do your best to retrace your steps and find your way out. To survive in the forest, you will need shelter, fire, food, and water. The forest will provide materials that you need to make a makeshift tent and start a fire, which will keep you warm and protect you.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Pay close attention to your surroundings and landmarks and relate this to your location on a map.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Stay calm if you get lost</strong>. Panic is your greatest enemy. If you run wildly around, even for a little while you could lose your sense of direction complete. Try to remember how you got to your present location.
</p><p><strong>Trust your map and compass</strong> (if you have them) and do not walk aimlessly. Use the compass to give you a sense of direction. Think of which way you came, and if that was Northeast, and then recall if you took a turn and what the direction the turn was. If you are calm, you can remember a great many things. If you are on a trail do not leave it.
</p><p><strong>Start retracing your steps</strong>. Leave markers where ever you go, so you can return to where you are. Also, if someone tries to find you, they will look for markers. So make as many as you can, on every turn that you make, and try to mark the direction you are taking. You got off the trail, maybe ten minutes ago, so if you track back more than that time, you know you are on the wrong track.
</p><p><strong>Remember that if you are not able to retrace your steps</strong>, then the best thing is to just stay put, in one place and let the searchers find you. Create a marking so it can be seen by air. Sing loudly or shout help, when you hear others trying to find you. If you have a whistle, blow it or use a blade of grass. Stay in the open so they can find you easily. Do not hide in a cave or under brushes.
</p><p><strong>Stay put if it is nightfall</strong>, if you are injured, or if you are near exhaustion. It is smarter to stay put and try to find your way out in the daylight.
</p><p><strong>Remember that as a last resort</strong>, follow a drainage or stream downhill or downstream. This can be hard going but will often lead to a trail or road. and you will eventually come to civilization.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
