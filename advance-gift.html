One of America’s gifts to us is efficiency, the scientific coordination of planning and action, the philosophy of correct and timely execution. Though long schooled in our Oriental disrespect for Time and encouraged, though unwittingly, to expect the Will that causes the palay to grow to also do our work for us, we realize at last that Time is an element to reckon with, that life here and now, being spread thinly over a limited period of years, must be economized and put to some profitable use. 
Our special significance is this realization in the economic life of our people. The bureaucratic system has impressed upon most of us that we must observe punctuality or lose out; that out pay envelop comes to many of us during stated periods of the month and not before or after, although we may spend its content in advance; and that our efficiency of times detrmine our income.</a>

Looking at the map, what information should be added to support this idea? 9. Give some similarities of the Nile River to the Pasig River and other rivers in the country? 10 Do you personally believe that Manila would advance today without the Pasig River? and why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. It flooded its banks and improved the land every year. Many fish and birds, which Egyptians utilized as food, were found in its waterways. The Nile River is the world's longest river, stretching 4,160 km. It emerges in the Mediterranean Sea after flowing north from the center of Africa through Egypt.</p><p></p><p>2. <br />a. The Pyramids of Giza</p><p>b. The Temple of Ramses II</p><p>c. The Great Pyramids</p><p></p><p>3. Northeastern Africa's principal river that flows north is the Nile. The Mediterranean Sea receives its discharge. The Amazon River is just a little bit longer than the Nile, which is the largest river in Africa and has long been thought to be the longest river in the world. Along with the River Amazon in South America, the River Nile in Africa is one of the world's longest rivers. Also included are the Congo, Mackenzie, and Mississippi Rivers.</p><p></p><p>4. Humans receive various advantages from nature. Nature improves our welfare and freely supplies the necessities for our life in the form of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. The idea of ecosystem services has been debated by scientists and environmentalists for decades. The more you don't care about the environment, the more it will be contaminated with chemicals and pollutants that are bad for our health. Among other issues and diseases, air pollution can cause cancer and respiratory conditions.</p><p></p><p>5. Sowing and plowing with crude wooden plows began when the flood levels subsided. Egypt receives very little rainfall, hence the sole supply of moisture required to maintain crops was given by the floods. Inundation is the term used to describe the river's yearly flooding. Farmers were nevertheless able to grow their crops in rich, well-watered soil. The silt that was left behind by the inundation was transported by the Nile from the Ethiopian Highlands.</p><p></p><p>6. Egypt is known as the "Gift of the Nile" because the river is its lifeblood. Egypt would have been a desert if not for the Nile. In the past, the Nile provided water for Egypt's crop cultivation, which facilitated the development of numerous civilizations along the river valley.</p><p></p><p>7. B. The map shows the various structures built near the Nile River</p><p></p><p>8. The White Nile and the Blue Nile are two of the Nile's tributaries. The longest of the two rivers, the White Nile, rises in Tanzania at Lake Victoria and travels north until it reaches Khartoum, Sudan, where it joins the Blue Nile. In Ethiopia, close to Lake Tana, the Blue Nile originates.</p><p></p><p>9. Both of them are the biggest rivers in their respective nations. The Nile River runs across eastern Africa from south to north, whereas the Pasig River cuts through the market town of Pasig and divides Manila in two. They are regarded as the largest and longest-running lakes in their regions and countries, in terms of a body of flowing water.</p><p></p><p>10. If people and companies continue to throw their rubbish in the river, no amount of waste extraction or dredging will revive it. The DENR and the local government entities will need to exert tremendous political will to restore the Pasig River. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Program intends to continue rehabilitation operations and enhance the Pasig River System's water quality to support the growth of aquatic life, transportation, and tourism.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Nile River flows from south to north through eastern Africa. It begins in the rivers that flow into Lake Victoria (located in modern-day Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya), and empties into the Mediterranean Sea more than 6,600 kilometers (4,100 miles) to the north, making it one of the longest river in the world. The Nile River was critical to the development of ancient Egypt. In addition to Egypt, the Nile runs through or along the border of 10 other African countries, namely, Burundi, Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, and South Sudan. Its three main tributaries are the White Nile, the Blue Nile, and the Atbara.</p><p></p><p>The soil of the Nile River delta between El Qâhira (Cairo) and the Mediterranean Sea is rich in nutrients, due to the large silt deposits the Nile leaves behind as it flows into the sea. The banks of the Nile all along its vast length contain rich soil as well, thanks to annual flooding that deposits silt. From space, the contrast between the Nile's lush green river banks and the barren desert through which it flows is obvious.</p><p></p><p>For millennia, much of Egypt's food has been cultivated in the Nile delta region. Ancient Egyptians developed irrigation methods to increase the amount of land they could use for crops and support a thriving population. Beans, cotton, wheat, and flax were important and abundant crops that could be easily stored and traded.</p><p></p><p>The Nile River delta was also an ideal growing location for the papyrus plant. Ancient Egyptians used the papyrus plant in many ways, such as making cloth, boxes, and rope, but by far its most important use was in making paper. Besides using the river's natural resources for themselves and trading them with others, early Egyptians also used the river for bathing, drinking, recreation, and transportation.</p><p></p><p>Today, 95 percent of Egyptians live within a few kilometers of the Nile. Canals bring water from the Nile to irrigate farms and support cities. The Nile supports agriculture and fishing. The Nile also has served as an important transportation route for thousands of years. Today, some residents of El Qâhira (Cairo) have begun using private speed boats, water taxis, or ferries to avoid crowded streets. Dams, such as the Aswân High Dam in Egypt, have been built to help to tame the river and provide a source of hydroelectric power.</p><p></p><p>However, the silt and sediment that used to flow north, enriching the soil and building the delta, is now building up behind the dam instead. Instead of growing in size through the soil deposits, the delta is now shrinking due to erosion along the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, routine annual flooding no longer occurs along parts of the Nile. These floods were necessary to flush and clean the water of human and agricultural waste. As a result, the water is becoming more polluted.</p><p></p><p>The Nile River also continues to be an important trade route, connecting Africa with markets in Europe and beyond.</p><br />

Though long schooled in our Oriental disrespect for Time and encouraged, though unwittingly, to expect the Will that causes the palay to grow to also do our work for us, we realize at last that Time is an element to reckon with, that life here and now, being spread thinly over a limited period of years, must be economized and put to some profitable use. 
Our special significance is this realization in the economic life of our people. The bureaucratic system has impressed upon most of us that we must observe punctuality or lose out; that out pay envelop comes to many of us during stated periods of the month and not before or after, although we may spend its content in advance; and that our efficiency of times detrmine our income.</h2><br />
