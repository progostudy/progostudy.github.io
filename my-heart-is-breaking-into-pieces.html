As a result, he sent out a terrible orderThe whole area was told to put all the old people to deathThis order led to terrible times. Many people simply abandoned theirold people to die. The poor farmer who lived at the bottom of themountain was very upset He dearly loved his mother and the orderof the wicked ruler. So, he tried to find the kindest way to put his mothercaused him great pain. But no one had ever dared to disobey the orderunwhitened rice. This was the main food for people like him and hisAt the end of the day, with his work completed, the farmer took somemother. He cooked it, dried it, and tied it up in a square cloth. He thenswung it in a bundle over his shoulder, along with a pitcher filled withto deathcool water. Next, he lifted his mother onto his back and began to climbthe mountainThe trail up the mountain was long and steep. It was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by hunters and woodcutters. At somepoints, they got lost and confused, but the farmer didn't care. He justkept climbing upwards toward the top of the mountain. This area wasknown as Obatsuyama, which means "abandoning of the aged."The man's mother, traveling on her son's back, noticed that he wasunsure where he was going. He was wandering from one path toanother She was worried that he would get into trouble on his way backdown So, as they travelled, she reached out her hand and snappedbranch twigs. She dropped a handful every w steps to show the waybackFinally, they got to the top of the mountain. The man was tired but hewas also heartbroken at the thought of abandoning his mother He putdown the rice and water and prepared a comfortable place for hismother. He made a soft bed out of fallen pine needles and gently placedhis mother upon it. The man wrapped his mother's padded coat aroundher shoulders. Then, with tears in his eyes and pain in his heart, he saidgoodbyeThe old mother gave a last piece of advice to her son. Her voice wastrembling with unselfish love. She said, "My son, do not let your eyes beblinded the mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and followthe path with piles or wigs on it They will guide you back to the pathyou know lower down the mountain."The son looked back over the path and was surprised to see the pilesof vigs. Then he looked down at the poor, old shriveled hands of hismother. They were scratched and dirty because of the loving work shehad done for him. He bowed down to give her honor and, with his heartbreaking said, "Oh, dear mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I willnot leave you Together wo will follow the path of twigs, and together weOnce again, ho put his mother on his back and set off down themountain.

He made sure she had all the food that sheneeded But he was always worried that she would be discovered.Time passed and the son began to feel safe again But then the rulersent out another order.

Then his motherspoke up."Waitl" she said. "I will think! I will thinki"After two days of thinking, she told him what to do"Make a rope of twisted straw," she said. "Then stretch it upon a rowof flat stones and burn it on a windless night"The son called the people together. They worked together to do justas his mother had said. When the fire died down, lying upon the stoneswas a perfectly shaped rope of ashesWhen the ruler came down, he was very pleased at the clevernessof the farmer and gave him lots of praise. But he also demanded to knowwhere the man's wisdom had come from. The farmer cried out, I cannotliel" Then he went on to tell the ruler his story.The ruler listened carefully then thought for a long time. Finally, helifted his head and said, "Shining needs more than strength and youthI forgot the old saying.

                                            The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you
10
Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</a>

As a result, he sent out a terrible orderThe whole area was told to put all the old people to deathThis order led to terrible times. Many people simply abandoned theirold people to die. The poor farmer who lived at the bottom of themountain was very upset He dearly loved his mother and the orderof the wicked ruler. So, he tried to find the kindest way to put his mothercaused him great pain. But no one had ever dared to disobey the orderunwhitened rice. This was the main food for people like him and hisAt the end of the day, with his work completed, the farmer took somemother. He cooked it, dried it, and tied it up in a square cloth. He thenswung it in a bundle over his shoulder, along with a pitcher filled withto deathcool water. Next, he lifted his mother onto his back and began to climbthe mountainThe trail up the mountain was long and steep. It was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by hunters and woodcutters. At somepoints, they got lost and confused, but the farmer didn't care. He justkept climbing upwards toward the top of the mountain. This area wasknown as Obatsuyama, which means "abandoning of the aged."The man's mother, traveling on her son's back, noticed that he wasunsure where he was going. He was wandering from one path toanother She was worried that he would get into trouble on his way backdown So, as they travelled, she reached out her hand and snappedbranch twigs. She dropped a handful every w steps to show the waybackFinally, they got to the top of the mountain. The man was tired but hewas also heartbroken at the thought of abandoning his mother He putdown the rice and water and prepared a comfortable place for hismother. He made a soft bed out of fallen pine needles and gently placedhis mother upon it. The man wrapped his mother's padded coat aroundher shoulders. Then, with tears in his eyes and pain in his heart, he saidgoodbyeThe old mother gave a last piece of advice to her son. Her voice wastrembling with unselfish love. She said, "My son, do not let your eyes beblinded the mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and followthe path with piles or wigs on it They will guide you back to the pathyou know lower down the mountain."The son looked back over the path and was surprised to see the pilesof vigs. Then he looked down at the poor, old shriveled hands of hismother. They were scratched and dirty because of the loving work shehad done for him. He bowed down to give her honor and, with his heartbreaking said, "Oh, dear mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I willnot leave you Together wo will follow the path of twigs, and together weOnce again, ho put his mother on his back and set off down themountain. The weight seemed light to him now and he was able to makeit through the shadows and the moonlight down to their little hut. Underthe kitchen floor was a hidden basement where food was stored Theson hid his mother in there. He made sure she had all the food that sheneeded But he was always worried that she would be discovered.Time passed and the son began to feel safe again But then the rulersent out another order. This one was extremely unreasonable Hewanted his people to give him a gift of a rope made of ashesEveryone was in fear. The order had to be obeyed, yet no one in allof Shining knew how to make a rope of ashes. Then, one night, the sontold his mother about the new order from the ruler. Then his motherspoke up."Waitl" she said. "I will think! I will thinki"After two days of thinking, she told him what to do"Make a rope of twisted straw," she said. "Then stretch it upon a rowof flat stones and burn it on a windless night"The son called the people together. They worked together to do justas his mother had said. When the fire died down, lying upon the stoneswas a perfectly shaped rope of ashesWhen the ruler came down, he was very pleased at the clevernessof the farmer and gave him lots of praise. But he also demanded to knowwhere the man's wisdom had come from. The farmer cried out, I cannotliel" Then he went on to tell the ruler his story.The ruler listened carefully then thought for a long time.

                            4. The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you
10
Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</h2><br />
