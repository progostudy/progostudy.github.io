                                            A rainbow is a multicolored arc made by light striking water droplets. The most familiar type of rainbow is produced when sunlight strikes raindrops in front of a viewer at a precise angle (42 degrees). Rainbows can also be viewed around fog, sea spray, or waterfalls. A rainbow is an optical illusion—it does not actually exist in a specific spot in the sky. The appearance of a rainbow depends on where you're standing and where the sun (or other source of light) is shining. The sun or other source of light is usually behind the person seeing the rainbow. In fact, the center of a primary rainbow is the antisolar point, the imaginary point exactly opposite the sun. 
Rainbows are the result of the refraction and reflection of light. Both refraction and reflection are phenomena that involve a change in a wave's direction. A refracted wave may appear "bent", while a reflected wave might seem to "bounce back" from a surface or other wavefront.Light entering a water droplet is refracted. It is then reflected by the back of the droplet. As this reflected light leaves the droplet, it is refracted again, at multiple angles.
 The radius of a rainbow is determined by the water droplets' refractive index. A refractive index is the measure of how much a ray of light refracts (bends) as it passes from one medium to another—from air to water, for example. A droplet with a high refractive index will help produce a rainbow with a smaller radius. Saltwater has a higher refractive index than freshwater, for instance, so rainbows formed by sea spray will be smaller than rainbows formed by rain.Rainbows are actually full circles. The antisolar point is the center of the circle. Viewers in aircraft can sometimes see these circular rainbows. 
Viewers on the ground can only see the light reflected by raindrops above the horizon. Because each person's horizon is a little different, no one actually sees a full rainbow from the ground. In fact, no one sees the same rainbow—each person has a different antisolar point, each person has a different horizon. Someone who appears below or near the "end" of a rainbow to one viewer will see another rainbow, extending from his or her own horizon.

                                            Directions: Categorize the following words in their respective type of sources. Synthesis is a written discussion taken from different sources. Simply, you take information from different references relevant to your topic and then create an overall point. It is important that you analyze the interrelationship among sources to come up with a good synthesis. In creating synthesis, you must analyze the relationship or connection of these sources and the ideas must be assessed and put in an orderly manner. Primary sources are first-hand or direct accounts from people. Also, these reflect the individual viewpoint and can be either verbal or non-verbal. In literature, those who have written a novel or poem are considered primary resources. The books or article about the novel or poem are labeled as secondary resources. In history, during the Edsa Revolution in 1986, those who have witnessed this event may write or share their experiences through a diary, interview, photographs, speeches, audio recordings, or poem (primary sources). On occasion, those who will study the same topic can analyze or interpret these primary sources and produce another work which will be noted as secondary source. Secondary sources are documents written based from the primary sources. Additionally, synthesis and summary are not the same. In synthesis, you will combine different ideas from relevant sources to come up with a concrete point. On the contrary, summary is plainly an organized written presentation from a single text. The process of synthesizing is normal since you often infer relationship between the movies you have watched with the books that you have read. Also, you may look for the similarities and differences in doing synthesis. Examples are provided below. Articles Diaries Encyclopedia Interview Observation Personal Experience Reviews Textbooks</a>

In fact, every unit of our society is indeed affected by this crisis. As a student, try to reflect from within since you are one of the primary victims of this current situation. Then answer this question, how are you being affected by various challenges? How do you cope in the changes brought about by this new normal? Express your thoughts through a poem. You can refer to the given example below. o POEM: Life is Geometric by Mary Grace Rayala Our life is finite never infinite Arranged in a sequence Geometric as it may seem Take time to reflect and see where and what you've been. Set your visions and goals But remember to start with your first term Accomplish them one by one, step by step as they say Multiply your achievements with joy As you travel life's journey until your nth term.​</a>

                        <p><strong>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY REFLECTION:</strong></p><strong>Primary reflection </strong>emphasizes the abstraction of something, object, by breaking something analytically into its main constituent parts. It is concerned with essence to solve problems. Whereas <strong>secondary reflection</strong> is not abstractly, synthetically, it is without dividing.<p></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p>Self reflection is obtained (primary reflection) from their family environment. For example, primary concepts are obtained not only from their parents, but all family members and friends contribute to the development of a person's self-concept. The primary concept is the most important and most basic concept, therefore the primary concept develops first than the secondary concept.</p><p></p><p>There is so much connection between life and reflection. The more we understand the idea of experience in its precise dimensions, actively and even boldly say in its crucial aspect, the better we will understand how experience cannot fail to transform us into reflection, and we are even right to say that the richer the experience, the more also the reflection.</p><p></p><p>But at this point we have to take it one step further and understand the fact that reflection itself can manifest itself in a person on many levels. Is it more of a primary reflection, or a secondary reflection. Roughly speaking, we can say that where primary reflection tends to dissolve the unity of experience that comes first, the function of secondary reflection is essentially healing, secondary reflection reclaims that unity.</p><p></p><p>Then someone gets concepts outside the family environment, secondary reflections are beneficial or even detrimental to the individual. But usually the primary self-reflection (which is embedded from the family) can influence a person in choosing the conditions or situations in which secondary self-reflection are formed. </p><p></p><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><p>For example, if religion is introduced in the family, good habits are instilled according to religious commands and prohibitions, then a person can choose a good environmental condition so that secondary self-reflection is also beneficial for him. The extent to which the primary and secondary concepts will be integrated will depend on the degree of continuity between the primary and secondary sociocultural environments themselves. A child who grew up in a family environment where he was the center of attention, but then was forced to change his self-concept in the community or school environment where his position would be very different.</p><p></p><p>Let's see more about self reflection on political self here:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/22631423</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            4. A rainbow is a multicolored arc made by light striking water droplets. The most familiar type of rainbow is produced when sunlight strikes raindrops in front of a viewer at a precise angle (42 degrees). Rainbows can also be viewed around fog, sea spray, or waterfalls. A rainbow is an optical illusion—it does not actually exist in a specific spot in the sky. The appearance of a rainbow depends on where you're standing and where the sun (or other source of light) is shining. The sun or other source of light is usually behind the person seeing the rainbow. In fact, the center of a primary rainbow is the antisolar point, the imaginary point exactly opposite the sun. 
Rainbows are the result of the refraction and reflection of light. Both refraction and reflection are phenomena that involve a change in a wave's direction. A refracted wave may appear "bent", while a reflected wave might seem to "bounce back" from a surface or other wavefront.Light entering a water droplet is refracted. It is then reflected by the back of the droplet. As this reflected light leaves the droplet, it is refracted again, at multiple angles.
 The radius of a rainbow is determined by the water droplets' refractive index. A refractive index is the measure of how much a ray of light refracts (bends) as it passes from one medium to another—from air to water, for example. A droplet with a high refractive index will help produce a rainbow with a smaller radius. Saltwater has a higher refractive index than freshwater, for instance, so rainbows formed by sea spray will be smaller than rainbows formed by rain.Rainbows are actually full circles. The antisolar point is the center of the circle. Viewers in aircraft can sometimes see these circular rainbows. 
Viewers on the ground can only see the light reflected by raindrops above the horizon. Because each person's horizon is a little different, no one actually sees a full rainbow from the ground. In fact, no one sees the same rainbow—each person has a different antisolar point, each person has a different horizon. Someone who appears below or near the "end" of a rainbow to one viewer will see another rainbow, extending from his or her own horizon.

                            5. A rainbow is a multicolored arc made by light striking water droplets. The most familiar type of rainbow is produced whensunlight strikes raindrops in front of a viewer at a precise angle (42 degrees). Rainbows can also be viewed around fog, sea spray,or waterfalls. A rainbow is an optical illusion—it does not actually exist in a specific spot in the sky. The appearance of a rainbowdepends on where you're standing and where the sun (or other source of light) is shining. The sun or other source of light is usuallybehind the person seeing the rainbow. In fact, the center of a primary rainbow is the antisolar point, the imaginary point exactlyopposite the sun.Rainbows are the result of the refraction and reflection of light. Both refraction and reflection are phenomena that involve achange in a wave's direction. A refracted wave may appear "bent", while a reflected wave might seem to "bounce back" from asurface or other wavefront.Light entering a water droplet is refracted. It is then reflected by the back of the droplet. As this reflectedlight leaves the droplet, it is refracted again, at multiple angles.The radius of a rainbow is determined by the water droplets' refractive index. A refractive index is the measure of how much aray of light refracts (bends) as it passes from one medium to another—from air to water, for example. A droplet with a high refractiveindex will help produce a rainbow with a smaller radius. Saltwater has a higher refractive index than freshwater, for instance, sorainbows formed by sea spray will be smaller than rainbows formed by rain.Rainbows are actually full circles. The antisolar point isthe center of the circle. Viewers in aircraft can sometimes see these circular rainbows.Viewers on the ground can only see the light reflected by raindrops above the horizon. Because each person's horizon is a littledifferent, no one actually sees a full rainbow from the ground. In fact, no one sees the same rainbow—each person has a differentantisolar point, each person has a different horizon. Someone who appears below or near the "end" of a rainbow to one viewer willsee another rainbow, extending from his or her own horizon.Guide Question1.Visible light waves are the only magnetic waves we can see. We can see these waves as the color of rainbows. Each color has adifferent wavelength \. Now, Which color of lights has the longest wavelength, has a shortest wavelength?2. In the picture, identify something that resembles a polygon? Determine whether it is convex or not.Ples po ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Violet has the shortest wavelength while red has the shortest wavelength </p><p>2. A raindrop is similar to a prism. It is convex. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. As the full spectrum of visible light travels through a prism, the wavelengths separate into the colors of the rainbow because each color is a different wavelength. Violet has the shortest wavelength, at around 380 nanometers, and red has the longest wavelength, at around 700 nanometers. </p><p>2. Raindrops behave like small prisms, so they bend the different colors of the sunlight and disperse them out into a band of colors that appears as a rainbow. Water is denser than the surrounding air, and when the light moves out of raindrops, it moves into separate wavelengths. </p><br />

                            23. Directions: Categorize the following words in their respective type of sources. Synthesis is a written discussion taken from different sources. Simply, you take information from different references relevant to your topic and then create an overall point. It is important that you analyze the interrelationship among sources to come up with a good synthesis. In creating synthesis, you must analyze the relationship or connection of these sources and the ideas must be assessed and put in an orderly manner. Primary sources are first-hand or direct accounts from people. Also, these reflect the individual viewpoint and can be either verbal or non-verbal. In literature, those who have written a novel or poem are considered primary resources. The books or article about the novel or poem are labeled as secondary resources. In history, during the Edsa Revolution in 1986, those who have witnessed this event may write or share their experiences through a diary, interview, photographs, speeches, audio recordings, or poem (primary sources). On occasion, those who will study the same topic can analyze or interpret these primary sources and produce another work which will be noted as secondary source. Secondary sources are documents written based from the primary sources. Additionally, synthesis and summary are not the same. In synthesis, you will combine different ideas from relevant sources to come up with a concrete point. On the contrary, summary is plainly an organized written presentation from a single text. The process of synthesizing is normal since you often infer relationship between the movies you have watched with the books that you have read. Also, you may look for the similarities and differences in doing synthesis. Examples are provided below.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are two types of syntheses: explanatory syntheses and argumentative syntheses. Explanatory syntheses seek to bring sources together to explain a perspective and the reasoning behind it. Argumentative syntheses seek to bring sources together to make an argument. Both types of synthesis involve looking for relationships between sources and drawing conclusions.</p><p>In order to successfully synthesize your sources, you might begin by grouping your sources by topic and looking for connections. For example, if you were researching the pros and cons of encouraging healthy eating in children, you would want to separate your sources to find which ones agree with each other and which ones disagree.</p><p>After you have a good idea of what your sources are saying, you want to construct your body paragraphs in a way that acknowledges different sources and highlights where you can draw new conclusions.</p><p></p><br />
