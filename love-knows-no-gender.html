                                            all of my siblings and parents are homophobic, and being the youngest daughter I'm lesbian but they don't know that i like girls. A news showed in our T.V of a married lesbians couple, and i saw how my father reacts, and he even cursed the couples saying that they are idiots because they are both girls. I am deeply hurt at that time but i didn't say anything and choose to be quite. I'm very scared how will they going to react if they'll going to find out that i like the same gender (girlXgirl). And also, my mother shared a story about her co-teacher being lesbian, that teacher has a relationship with a girl but a few years, she broke up with her girlfried and choosed to marry a man, and i ask my mother why they both broke up, and she said that its not good being in a relationship with the same gender according to Bible, but i also said that it doesn't matter if you love each others even your same gender, but she disagreed at my statement and i ask her once again if she's homophobic,but she didn't answer my question. Instead of answering my question she said that she silently DISGUSTED to her co-teacher because she loved the same gender, and once i heard what she say, i already know that she's homophobic. I feel very very bad for my self and im scared already to love someone because of them. SHOULD I TAKE THE RISK LOVING SOMEONE IN SAME GENDER OR JUST LET IT GO AND LOVE A MAN? i'm having a lot of problem into these days but no one can even help me, even my own family can't help me.this is not a part of my school work but im just sharing my problems in here, cause why not?:)​</a>

This is a sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society)It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children? Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake. Mr. Serge: (Gay)I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally. Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is meant for him. As long as they know their limitations and overcome the consequences in their relationship.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I disagree that love knows no gender. While it is true that love can exist between any two people regardless of their gender, the way in which we express and experience love can be heavily influenced by our gender identity. For example, men may express their feelings of love differently than women, such as through physical touch or acts of service rather than verbal expressions. Additionally, different genders may have different expectations for how they want to receive and give love in a relationship. Therefore, while it is possible for anyone to experience and express love regardless of their gender identity, the way in which this happens can be significantly impacted by one's gender.</p><br />

                            12. all of my siblings and parents are homophobic, and being the youngest daughter I'm lesbian but they don't know that i like girls. A news showed in our T.V of a married lesbians couple, and i saw how my father reacts, and he even cursed the couples saying that they are idiots because they are both girls. I am deeply hurt at that time but i didn't say anything and choose to be quite. I'm very scared how will they going to react if they'll going to find out that i like the same gender (girlXgirl). And also, my mother shared a story about her co-teacher being lesbian, that teacher has a relationship with a girl but a few years, she broke up with her girlfried and choosed to marry a man, and i ask my mother why they both broke up, and she said that its not good being in a relationship with the same gender according to Bible, but i also said that it doesn't matter if you love each others even your same gender, but she disagreed at my statement and i ask her once again if she's homophobic,but she didn't answer my question. Instead of answering my question she said that she silently DISGUSTED to her co-teacher because she loved the same gender, and once i heard what she say, i already know that she's homophobic. I feel very very bad for my self and im scared already to love someone because of them. SHOULD I TAKE THE RISK LOVING SOMEONE IN SAME GENDER OR JUST LET IT GO AND LOVE A MAN? i'm having a lot of problem into these days but no one can even help me, even my own family can't help me.this is not a part of my school work but im just sharing my problems in here, cause why not?:)​</h2><br />

And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally.

Analyze each excerpt by answering the following guide questions after. "Give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world, and ten to one but she has the means of settling well, without further expense to anybody." - from Mansfield Park "The more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much!" - from Sense and Sensibility "What are men to rocks and mountains?" - from Pride and Prejudice Guide questions: 1. Based on the given excerpts, how does Jane Austen perceive women? 2. Does Jane Austen view all genders equally? Which of the excepts will support your answer. Explain.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or attitudes. However, I can analyze the given excerpts from Jane Austen's novels for you.</p><p></p><p>1. Based on the given excerpts, Jane Austen perceives women as capable of achieving success if given the right opportunities and education. She also depicts women as having high standards and expectations in relationships, which may make it challenging for them to find a suitable partner. Furthermore, Jane Austen showcases through her writing the idea that women may be undervalued and not given equal opportunities in society.</p><p></p><p>2. In terms of gender equality, Jane Austen does not view both genders equally. The excerpt from “Pride and Prejudice” which says “What are men to rocks and mountains?” indicates that she identifies nature and the beauty of the world as more valuable than men. However, this is just a single excerpt, and it does not necessarily imply that all of her writings promote the idea of inequality between genders.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>THANKS ME LATER </p><br />
