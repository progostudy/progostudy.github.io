                                            Hard? You do not know what hard is, boy:
When I was your age, we got up in the pitch dark,
And walked five miles to school and ten miles back,
Uphill both ways and all we had for lunch
Was a cold sweet potato and dried fish.
And when we got back home, your grandma made us
Chop wood, feed the hogs, then milk the cows
Before supper, and all we had to eat
Was porridge and boiled cassava
Maybe some fried kangkong. Maybe some boiled eggs.
But what do you know? Shoot! you have always had
Hot fried chicken in front of you, like magic.
For you, it’s all ice cream and coke

                                            part two of singing
Summer after high school when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you I put those records on (whoa)
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
But in another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me (whoa)
'Cause now I pay the price
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
The one (the one)
The one (the one)
The one (the one)
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
someone reported me earlier :(</a>

                            21. Hard? You do not know what hard is, boy:
When I was your age, we got up in the pitch dark,
And walked five miles to school and ten miles back,
Uphill both ways and all we had for lunch
Was a cold sweet potato and dried fish.
And when we got back home, your grandma made us
Chop wood, feed the hogs, then milk the cows
Before supper, and all we had to eat
Was porridge and boiled cassava
Maybe some fried kangkong. Maybe some boiled eggs.
But what do you know? Shoot! you have always had
Hot fried chicken in front of you, like magic.
For you, it’s all ice cream and coke

                            28. part two of singing
Summer after high school when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you I put those records on (whoa)
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
But in another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me (whoa)
'Cause now I pay the price
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
The one (the one)
The one (the one)
The one (the one)
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away
someone reported me earlier :(</h2><br />
