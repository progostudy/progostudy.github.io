                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My answer is yes and no. I think that the people in offices and the people starting their own businesses have both their similarities and differences. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In terms of qualities, both possess the determination to succeed and the hard work to make their way to the top and make a name for themselves. </p><p>It's just that an entrepreneur possess these qualities <strong>to build a business from scratch</strong> while a person with an office job is working hard <strong>to help the company they work in become more successful</strong>. </p><p>In personalities, I can say entrepreneurs are risk-takers, especially for those who start from the bottom. Most of them spend a huge amount of money to curate their start-up products and to buy supplies they will need, and they also have no assurance that their business will succeed. As for office jobs, I think they are either staying in their comfort zone where they won't lose anything along the way and still succeed.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

</p>
These quotations were made by the well known <strong>Chinese confucius philosopher  that you must follow your parents and enable an independent person.  They don't want to know you  and they're concerned about your health.
</strong><p>
</p>That means that even if you don't see anything  you do, you have to do things right.  When we <strong>mature</strong>, <strong>we have to do things because we are discerning (who knows  the good and the bad), not only because somebody (our parent) watches over us.  But our parents have to be aware of what's  physically happening to us, as they are the best aid.

                        <p>Behave in such a way that your father and mother have no anxiety about you, except concerning your health.</p><p>It basically says that the best way to honor your parents is to not do anything to worry your parents. </p><p>We really can't control if we have diseases (except for those that are due to lifestyle), so parents will always worry about our health. We can't prevent this. For example, any auto-immune diseases or cancer, nobody can really prevent this fully.</p><p>But aside from health, we should behave honorably and live a life that they can be proud of, and comfortable with. For example, what if you were a drug pusher? Of course your parents would be worried about you, they'd think everyday that you would be caught, or turn up dead. But, if you live a simple, honest, and quiet life, they don't have to worry about you. They will be at ease.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><br />
