There are different people who can keep you informed about what you should do and where you can go. This could be your family, neighbors, and the media. Sometimes, police or local officials will also inform you if you need to leave your home. You may even have a local RC 143 Disaster Management Team that will help you in these times, guiding you on when to evacuate, what to bring, and where to go to stay safe in times of disaster. Your community may have a local warning system to announce if a hazard is approaching. This warning system could be a megaphone, a bell, a rain gauge, a colored flag, or a bamboo clapper. It's important to listen, watch, and talk to people around you."Get Ready For Disasters Workbook For intermediate Students 2018 Deped LR PortalPost ReadingWhat are the local warning devices used to announce the approaching disaster?What are the ways to learn if a disaster is coming?Have you ever experienced a disaster before?

There are different people who can keep you informed about what you should do and where you can go. This could be your family, neighbors, and the media. Sometimes, police or local officials will also inform you if you need to leave your home. You may even have a local RC 143 Disaster Management Team that will help you in these times, guiding you on when to evacuate, what to bring, and where to go to stay safe in times of disaster. Your community may have a local warning system to announce if a hazard is approaching. This warning system could be a megaphone, a bell, a rain gauge, a colored flag, or a bamboo clapper.
