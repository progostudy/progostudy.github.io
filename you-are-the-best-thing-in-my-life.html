Before I go to school, you _________________________. I can do it by myself, but you do it happily to show me you care. Now that reporting to school is temporarily stopped, you continue to do the things you have been used to doing for me. This made me feel __________________ especially that modular learning is ________________________. I admit I find it hard to accomplish all my written and performance tasks but you ________________________________. When face-to-face will be allowed, I will show you _________________________________________________and make you happier. The old me is now _____________________________. I am shaped by the challenges of the pandemic and inspired by your ______________________________________. I will study for the better and then for the best. I will try not to fail you and make your dream for me a reality. Yes, success is equal to my effort and your commendable labor for me. I promise to _______________. ​</a>

I care more for some others than I do myself but I have a huge nonchalant attitude. I don’t really show anger or sadness much I always smile because I’m optimistic about life. I look at life as if something bad comes along, no need to dwell on it you can’t take it back so just move-on and improve what you did wrong if it’s possible.…show more content…
I was taught to be caring and thoughtful; I wasn’t taught anything else from anyone other than not to trust people. I’m the odd ball of my family because I am nothing like anyone. I can say I was also taught to believe in myself and never down myself because I can accomplish anything. That is shown through my determination and hard work because if I didn’t believe in myself I wouldn’t try as hard. Last but not all, Humanistic approach sums up my personality a little more than psychodynamic does because it involves nature vs. nurture and that kind of sums it up just saying that. Environment and Heredity is kind of the main reasons of my attitudes and actions. In the article, Time-Limited Psychodynamic Psychotherapy, Briggs conducts different forms of psychotherapy techniques to prove whether things in an adolescent’s life effect different adolescents differently. His study was a success and proved that many adolescents have different interpretations on the same issue. He read them off different problems and wanted to see how they would interpret them. He used children in the age groups of 12-17 and it worked out. I think that the different approaches can be brought together in some circumstances but in my case it doesn’t. My personality makes more sense coming from the humanistic approach. Briggs, Stephen (2010).</a>

Write your answers below.The Power of Gratitude?by: Cynthia Q. LelinaHave you counted your blessings? Have you tried to thank God for giving your life?Have you thanked your parents for taking care of you? Giving you food, clothes, house tolive in and for sending you to school. When I watched Fr. Jerry Orbos in the Divine WordMedia PH, his quote caught my attention, “Gratitude is the Best Attitude”. To be gratefulfor everything we receive is something I am reminded of. The more we learn to be grateful,the more blessings we receive. So we must learn to thank even in the little things we receive.One great blessing to be grateful for to God is having our family because with them we canfulfill our dreams. Therefore, if we fill our hearts with gratefulness, this will lead us to ahappier and more peaceful life. That's the power of gratitude.​</a>

I don’t have rules for you to follow but I want you to reach your full potential by finding and enjoying the life that resides within you. I will lead you and help you enjoy life without restricting you. I only want to help you find the path of life that best fits you so we can become one in the way that fits you best.” -Vishnu(Hinduism) B. “I know life is difficult and I am here to help free you from the pain and difficulties of this life. I don’t have a specific path for you to follow. You can live how you want. If you want to escape the pain and suffering of this world then I will help you disconnect from the things of this world so you can be free from pain and suffering.” – Siddhartha Gautama (Buddhism) Guide Questions: 1. Why have you selected that excerpt? 2. What does your chosen excerpt entail? 3.

                                            My Quarantine Story Donna Teressa M. Oropel It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus— which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started— from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. My days always start with waking up early in the morning, clueless of what to do. I often ask myself, "Is there something productive to do?" Since I was clueless as ever, I started to plan everything out. I began to focus on improving my health by staying fit. I decided to have my daily exercise since my body had not been sweating out lately on account of being too pre-occupied with my job. I also included reading books and enrolling myself in free online classes to feed my intellect and broaden my knowledge. Then, when I have free time, I spoil myself with food, just enough, and with movies by binge-watching on Netflix. My Quarantine life may sound relaxing and fun, but it is not. With the news spreading and circulating on the internet about the increasing cases of people who caught the virus, I could not help but be anxious and sad about it. Many people lost their jobs and businesses— small or large scale, and it led to the extreme poverty of some. With that, every household must watch how they spend their money. Proper budgeting is a must to survive in this crisis. And as for my family, we only buy groceries once a week, and everything is already budgeted; it is not the best time to spend money on nonessentials. Lastly, with everything that is going on, I never forget to pray for the complete healing and safety of everybody. Praying the Holy Rosary is the last thing I do with my family before going to bed.My Quarantine life is not as fun or as exciting as always. However, in conclusion, the experiences I had while staying at home with my family, made me realize and reflect on a lot of things, one of which is the importance of taking good care of my health and appreciate every little time I spend with my loved ones. Life is indeed good, but it is short. It is fun until it is not. Life is unpredictable; we will never know when it will blow its surprise again1. What is the text all about?2.

Seizing Success with You Looking at myself, I can tell that becoming successful in my studies is impossible with me alone.Though I am enrolled in a public school, success is ___________________________________________________.Having you ____________________________(who are they?) in my life is truly a blessing. Before I go to school, you _________________________. I can do it by myself, but you do it happily to show me you care. Now that reporting to school is temporarily stopped, you continue to do the things you have been used to doing for me. This made me feel __________________ especially that modular learning is ________________________. I admit I find it hard to accomplish all my written and performance tasks but you ________________________________. When face-to-face will be allowed, I will show you _________________________________________________and make you happier. The old me is now _____________________________. I am shaped by the challenges of the pandemic and inspired by your ______________________________________. I will study for the better and then for the best. I will try not to fail you and make your dream for me a reality. Yes, success is equal to my effort and your commendable labor for me. I promise to _______________. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Wondering what makes a student successful? Chances are, you can conjure up a clear picture in your mind of what the ideal student looks like: on time, always prepared, engaged in learning, and earning effortless As. What’s their secret? Are they just naturally more gifted? Or is it that they’ve cracked the code to academic prosperity and have learned to implement strategies that make success a habit? We think it’s the latter, which is why we’re covering the top tips for cultivating student success today and far into your academic future.</p><p></p><p>Show Up</p><p>This sounds simple enough. Show up, pay attention, and you’ve already set yourself up to perform well. However, as you gain more autonomy in your academics it can be easy to want to hit the snooze or skip out after lunchtime before your dreaded algebra class. Don’t fall victim to thinking skipping class will be inconsequential, no big deal, or easier to make up at a later date. Chances are, class is your best opportunity to understand the material and have a chance to ask any questions that may arise - bringing us to tip number two.</p><p></p><p>Ask Questions</p><p>Successful students aren’t the ones that understand everything perfectly the first time, rather, they’re the ones that aren't afraid to ask questions until they do. Everyone excels at learning differently and at the Rose Academies, our teachers are here to help! It is a mark of a successful student to take charge of your own educational experience. If something isn’t making sense to you, it’s in your best interest to engage your resources until it does. This helps contribute to what makes a student successful.</p><p></p><p>Manage Your Time &amp; Don’t Multitask</p><p>Time management is a lifelong skill and something that will benefit you far beyond your high school days. As a student, one of your top priorities should be school, but it is likely not your only responsibility. That is why it’s important to plan ahead and be realistic about the time you need to do your best academically. Another time management tip is to not try to do everything at once.</p><p></p><p>Multitasking may seem like the most efficient way to get it all done, but research shows that multitasking not only slows the completion of tasks but also decreases the quality of the final product. So next time you think doing your math homework while listening to an audiobook for your next book report is killing two birds with one stone, take a step back, plan your time accordingly, and focus on one task at a time.</p><p></p><p>Set Goals</p><p>A good place to start with your time management strategy discussed above is to set goals and work backwards. Do you hope to have straight As this semester? Take a look at all the assignments leading up to final grades and set mini-goals to excel at those as well. Looking to graduate early? Plan out how many credits you’ll need to</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>yan ang sagot po</p><br />

                            9. Me Myself and Personality Traits When asked to describe myself I never know what to say, but I should know myself the best, right? I like to look at myself as a genuine, thoughtful young lady. I’m a hard worker; I believe nothing is ever handed to you so you have to go get it. I worked hard to get to this point of my life and working even harder to get to the successful and graduate part of my life. I care more for some others than I do myself but I have a huge nonchalant attitude. I don’t really show anger or sadness much I always smile because I’m optimistic about life. I look at life as if something bad comes along, no need to dwell on it you can’t take it back so just move-on and improve what you did wrong if it’s possible.…show more content…
I was taught to be caring and thoughtful; I wasn’t taught anything else from anyone other than not to trust people. I’m the odd ball of my family because I am nothing like anyone. I can say I was also taught to believe in myself and never down myself because I can accomplish anything. That is shown through my determination and hard work because if I didn’t believe in myself I wouldn’t try as hard. Last but not all, Humanistic approach sums up my personality a little more than psychodynamic does because it involves nature vs. nurture and that kind of sums it up just saying that. Environment and Heredity is kind of the main reasons of my attitudes and actions. In the article, Time-Limited Psychodynamic Psychotherapy, Briggs conducts different forms of psychotherapy techniques to prove whether things in an adolescent’s life effect different adolescents differently. His study was a success and proved that many adolescents have different interpretations on the same issue. He read them off different problems and wanted to see how they would interpret them. He used children in the age groups of 12-17 and it worked out. I think that the different approaches can be brought together in some circumstances but in my case it doesn’t. My personality makes more sense coming from the humanistic approach. Briggs, Stephen (2010).</h2><br />

Have you tried to thank God for giving your life?Have you thanked your parents for taking care of you? Giving you food, clothes, house tolive in and for sending you to school. When I watched Fr. Jerry Orbos in the Divine WordMedia PH, his quote caught my attention, “Gratitude is the Best Attitude”. To be gratefulfor everything we receive is something I am reminded of. The more we learn to be grateful,the more blessings we receive. So we must learn to thank even in the little things we receive.One great blessing to be grateful for to God is having our family because with them we canfulfill our dreams. Therefore, if we fill our hearts with gratefulness, this will lead us to ahappier and more peaceful life. That's the power of gratitude.​</h2><br />

I will lead you and help you enjoy life without restricting you. I only want to help you find the path of life that best fits you so we can become one in the way that fits you best.” -Vishnu(Hinduism) B. “I know life is difficult and I am here to help free you from the pain and difficulties of this life. I don’t have a specific path for you to follow. You can live how you want. If you want to escape the pain and suffering of this world then I will help you disconnect from the things of this world so you can be free from pain and suffering.” – Siddhartha Gautama (Buddhism) Guide Questions: 1. Why have you selected that excerpt? 2. What does your chosen excerpt entail? 3.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We can be better students and examples by paying attention, not distracting the class, and focusing more on our work. We should also not talk or play while inside of class. Being a better example means learning and listening to the teacher and not talking to our friends or anybody else. We  should also raise our hands and be polite when we treat each other and our teacher with respect we help others see this and then hopefully follow in our footsteps when other people do this others will see it and eventually everyone will be respectful but it's only about being respectful we also have to do our work and learn as well as being attentive and patient we shouldn't talk during class or be playing. We should take responsibility and not have to be told what to do. We should already know what to do. We should not interrupt anyone or talk during projects. We should always be on time and never show up late. Even if we don't like the work, I find it hard. We should still do it and try to understand and remember it. When you lead by example you can create a domino effect. One by one, people will want to be like that, and they will act like you. They will show up on time and do all their work, and they will not interrupt or play around or talk, they will be patient and try their hardest. But most importantly they will always try to be their best selves and always show up and be a part of the class. When we are our best selves others will be their best selves which will result in better work and working harder.Being a good example is behaving in a positive manner. Leading your life in a good way creates a scenario that others will most likely want to copy. For example, when parents demonstrate leadership, strength, guidance and responsibility, others will absorb the good behavior. Regardless if you agree or disagree with someone's opinions, always respect them. It is OK to have fun and be childlike from time to time but save it for break. However, there are times when you need to demonstrate maturity such as being in class. The opposite of leading by example is to say one thing and do another. The saying “do as I say, not as I do” may have worked in the past, but it has no place in today’s world.If someone is speaking to you, put away your computer or iPad or any other distractions and listen, and be patient and wait for your turn to speak. When the teacher is with another student we can raise hands and just wait and not wave our hands and make sounds. Being a good example means that we should put in extra work and check in on our team and always be present. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>For number 4 </p><br />

                        ➬ Laughter is the best medicine. Title - LAUGHTERIntroduction - Laughter is a powerful medicine. It attracts people in ways that cause healthy physical and emotional changes in the body. Laughter boosts your immune system, improves your mood, reduces pain, and protects you from the negative effects of stress.(Optional if you want the introduction to be longer) Nothing works faster or more consistently to restore balance to your mind and body than a good laugh. Humor lifts your spirits, gives you hope, connects you to others, and keeps you grounded, focused, and alert. It also aids in the release of anger and the forgiveness of others. Body - We used to laugh hundreds of times a day as children, but as adults, life becomes more serious and laughter becomes less frequent. However, by actively seeking out opportunities for humor and laughter, you can improve your emotional health, strengthen your relationships, find greater happiness, and even add years to your life. Conclusion - Nothing dispels rage and conflict like a good laugh. Looking for the humorous side of things can help you put problems into perspective and move on from confrontations without harboring bitterness or resentment.#Goodluck <p></p><br />

                            23. My Quarantine Story Donna Teressa M. Oropel It was a busy and ordinary day in March when I heard the news about the spreading virus— which, unfortunately, found to be deadly and dangerous because it attacks the body, specifically the immune system and the respiratory system. After hearing such dispiriting news, I, and the people in my workplace received a piece of advice to take precautionary measures and to stop reporting physically due to the threatening pandemic. It was the time when my Quarantine life started— from predictable and habitual routines to unexpected ones. My days always start with waking up early in the morning, clueless of what to do. I often ask myself, "Is there something productive to do?" Since I was clueless as ever, I started to plan everything out. I began to focus on improving my health by staying fit. I decided to have my daily exercise since my body had not been sweating out lately on account of being too pre-occupied with my job. I also included reading books and enrolling myself in free online classes to feed my intellect and broaden my knowledge. Then, when I have free time, I spoil myself with food, just enough, and with movies by binge-watching on Netflix. My Quarantine life may sound relaxing and fun, but it is not. With the news spreading and circulating on the internet about the increasing cases of people who caught the virus, I could not help but be anxious and sad about it. Many people lost their jobs and businesses— small or large scale, and it led to the extreme poverty of some. With that, every household must watch how they spend their money. Proper budgeting is a must to survive in this crisis. And as for my family, we only buy groceries once a week, and everything is already budgeted; it is not the best time to spend money on nonessentials. Lastly, with everything that is going on, I never forget to pray for the complete healing and safety of everybody. Praying the Holy Rosary is the last thing I do with my family before going to bed.My Quarantine life is not as fun or as exciting as always. However, in conclusion, the experiences I had while staying at home with my family, made me realize and reflect on a lot of things, one of which is the importance of taking good care of my health and appreciate every little time I spend with my loved ones. Life is indeed good, but it is short. It is fun until it is not. Life is unpredictable; we will never know when it will blow its surprise again1. What is the text all about?2.
