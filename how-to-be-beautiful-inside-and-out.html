                                            Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a powerful wizard named Alaric who was known for his incredible magic skills. He lived alone in a tall tower, hidden deep within the enchanted forest, and very few people had ever seen him.One day, a young girl named Lily stumbled upon Alaric's tower while exploring the forest. She was amazed by its beauty and decided to enter. As soon as she stepped inside, Alaric appeared before her.Lily was frightened at first, but Alaric was friendly and welcomed her inside. He was impressed by her courage and decided to teach her some magic tricks.As time went by, Lily learned more and more from Alaric, and they became close friends. She discovered that Alaric was actually a kind-hearted wizard who had been hiding from the world because he feared his power could be used for evil.One day, an evil sorcerer named Malakar arrived in the enchanted forest, and he was determined to destroy everything in his path. He had an army of dark creatures that obeyed his every command, and they began to terrorize the forest.Alaric and Lily knew they had to do something to stop Malakar, so they set out to gather the bravest warriors and wizards from all across the land. They formed a powerful army and marched into battle against Malakar and his minions.The battle was long and grueling, and it seemed like all hope was lost. But just when things were looking their bleakest, Lily remembered a spell that Alaric had taught her, and she used it to create a giant shield that protected the army from Malakar's attacks.With the shield in place, the army was able to regroup and launch a final attack against Malakar. Alaric used his most powerful magic to defeat the evil sorcerer, and the dark creatures disappeared back into the shadows.After the battle, Lily and Alaric were hailed as heroes, and they continued to teach magic to those who wished to learn. They became known as the protectors of the enchanted forest, and their legend lived on for generations to come.Question:1. What is the name of the wizard in the story?2. Where does Alaric live?3.

I just can’t help myself but to share to you a very beautiful
encounter I personally witnessed as I go to work.
You know, I have read a lot of posts in social media about cops
who become abusive of their power. One video that I watched
shows police brutality towards a bystander who allegedly
violated a protocol in this time of the pandemic. For not wearing
a mask, he was immediately detained. Others raged and asked
‘Could he be just fined?’ There was another
post about a ‘ginang’ who was accordingly detained after
having argued with a policeman. And many awkward and
untoward stories continue to surface that painted a bad image to our policemen.
I do not say that these stories are not true. But what I am pointing out here is
the fact that while some other policemen seem bad and abusive, majority of them
are not and are still working under their oath, that is to protect people from crimes.
One of the many good policemen happened to be the character of this good
encounter of mine.
I was on my way to work. It was difficult for me to flag down a taxi since it was
raining on that morning. I tried several times but the cabs could not just see me for
that part of the waiting shed was hidden by some trees plus the bad weather fog
seemed to darken that street. One, two, three, four times that I tried but still I could
not take one. I would be terribly late.
I was already hopeless when suddenly a police mobile came out from nowhere
and stopped at the side of the street. A man in uniform then came out from the car. I
guessed he was at his mid-40s.He had no umbrella but thank God the rain on that
moment wasn’t that hard to bathe him soon. He smiled at me and when he noticed
that a taxi was approaching, he made a sign for it to stop. It stopped. But what
surprised me and I didn’t expect more is when he took off his uniform and enveloped
me with it. So, I didn’t get moistened by rain as I got inside the cab. I thanked him for
his kindness and secretly read the name on his plate. ‘Macapagal, L.M.’ was
engraved on it. He nodded at me and assured that I owe nothing for his kindness.
He waved then as the car began to run. I will not forget that act of kindness.
When I reached home, I overheard our maids in the kitchen gigglingly talked
about a man who helped them carry their groceries after being stuck in the rain this
afternoon. According to Aling Carmen, our old maid, she would not surely forget the
name of that police guy for the rest of her life. As it was her first to receive such
kindness from a man of her dreams. But Aling Tessie, our jolly cook, teased Aling
Carmen that the police guy was only meant for herself and not for Aling Carmen.
And both of them giggled even more. When I asked them who this ‘knight with a
shining armor’ is they were talking about, both of them screamed ‘Macapagal, L.M!’
So, you see, it was the same guy who helped me earlier. Wow! It was just natural for that police guy to help! May many beautiful encounters continue to spread down the street!

She was lovely. She was tall. She looked up to my brother with a smile, and her forehead was on a level with his mouth. "You are Baldo," she said and placed her hand ligh ly on my shoulder. Her nails were long, but they were not painted. She was fragrant like a morning when papayas are in bloom. And a smau aimpie appeared momenty nign on ner right cheek. "And this is Labing of whom I have heard so much." She held the wrist of one hand with the other and looked at Labang, and Laban; never stopped chewing his cud. He swallowed and brought up to his mouth more cud and the sound of his insides was like a drum. I laid a hand on labang's massive neck and said to her, "You may scratch his forehead now." She hesitated and I saw that her eyes were on the long, curving horns. But she came and touched Labang's forehead with her long fir gers, and Labang never stopped chewing his cud except that his big eyes are hal-closed. And by and by she was scratching his forehead very daintily. My brother Leon put down the two trunks on the grassy side of the road. He paid Ca Celin twice the usual tare from the station to the age of Nagrepcan. Inen he was standing beside us, and she turned to him eagerly. I watched Ca Celin, where he stood in front of his horse, and he ran his fingers through its forelock and could not keep his eyes away from her. "Maria---" brother Leon said. my He did not say Maring. He did not say Mayang. I knew then that he had always called her Maria and that to us all she would be Maria, and in my mind. I said 'Maria and it was a beautiful name. Directions: Get to know more of the character described in the story. Fill out the graphic organizer below. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.

One day the mouse found a basket full of corn. There was a small hole in the basket. She went inside and began to eat the corn greedily. As she was very hungry, she went on eating and eating. Now, she had grown very fat. After the meal, the mouse tried to come out of the basket, she could not. Now, she was too fat to pass through the hole. She said," How shall I come out?" Just then a rat came along, and he heard the mouse. The rat said," Mouse, if you want to come out of the basket, you must wait till you have grown as thin were when you went in." 1. What is the story all about? 2. What is the moral lesson of the story? A Glass of Milk By: John Malam Once, there was a poor boy who made a living by selling various objects from door to door. This was the way he earned money to pay for his school. One day, as he was walking from house to house as usual, he felt very hungry and weak. He felt that he couldn't walk even a few steps. He decided to ask for food at a house. He knocked on the door and was stunned to see a beautiful young girl open the door. With much hesitation, he asked the girl for a glass of water. The young girl understood his condition and offered him a huge glass of milk. With an astonished look, the boy drank the milk very slowly. "How much do I owe you for this milk?" he asked her. The girl replied, "I do not want any money for this." The boy thanked the girl from the bottom of his heart and left the place. Years passed by. The young girl grew up. In her youth, unfortunately, she fell ill and was diagnosed with the rarest kind of nervous disorder. Many experienced doctors were baffled at her condition, and she was admitted in the city hospital with the most advanced facilities. 1. What is the story all about? 2.

                                            THE OLD FISHERMANOur house was directly across the street from the entrance of  a popular hospital in the city. We lived downstairs and rented the upstairs rooms to out patients at the clinic. One summer evening as I was fixing supper, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see a truly awful looking man.“Why, he’s hardly taller than my eight-year-old,” I thought as I stared at the stooped, shriveled body. But the appalling thing was his face–lopsided from swelling, red and raw. Yet his voice was pleasant as he said, “Good evening. I’ve come to see if you’ve a room for just one night. I came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore, and there’s no bus ’till the morning.”He told me he’d been hunting for a room since noon but he had no success as no one seemed to have a room. “I guess it’s my face. I know it looks terrible, but my doctor says with a few more treatments…”For a moment I hesitated, but his next words convinced me: “I could sleep in this rocking chair on the porch. My bus leaves early in the morning.” I told him we would find him a bed, but to rest on the porch.I went inside and finished getting supper. When we were ready, I asked the old man if he would join us “No thank you. I have plenty.” And he held up a brown paper bag. When I had finished the dishes, I went out on the porch to talk with him a few minutes.It didn’t take a long time to see that this old man had an oversized heart crowded into that tiny body. He told me he fished for a living to support his daughter, her five children, and her husband, who was hopelessly crippled from a back injury.He didn’t tell it by way of complaint; in fact, every other sentence was prefaced with a thanks to God for a blessing. He was grateful that no pain accompanied his disease, which was apparently a form of skin cancer. He thanked God for giving him the strength to keep going.At bedtime, we put a camp cot in the children’s room for him. When I got up in the morning, the bed linens were neatly folded and the little man was out on the porch. He refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, haltingly, as if asking a great favor, he said, “Could I please come back and stay the next time I have a treatment? I won’t put you out a bit. I can sleep fine in a chair.”He paused a moment and then added, “Your children made me feel at home. Grownups are bothered by my face, but children don’t seem to mind.” I told him he was welcome to come again.On his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and a quart of the largest oysters I had ever seen. He said he had shucked them that morning before he left so that they’d be nice and fresh. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us.In the years he came to stay overnight with us there was never a time that he did not bring us fish or oysters or vegetables from his garden. Other times we received packages in the mail, always by special delivery; fish and oysters packed in a box of fresh young spinach or kale, every leaf carefully washed.Knowing that he must walk three miles to mail these, and knowing how little money he had made the gifts more precious. When I received these little remembrances, I often thought of a comment our next-door neighbor made after he left that first morning. “Did you keep that awful looking man last night? I turned him away! You can lose roomers by putting up such people!”Maybe we did lose roomers once or twice. But oh! If only they could have known him, perhaps their illnesses would have been easier to bear. I know our family always will be grateful to have known him; from him we learned what it was to accept the bad without complaint and the good with gratitude.Recently I was visiting a friend who has a greenhouse. As she showed me her flowers, we came to the most beautiful one of all, a golden chrysanthemum, bursting with blooms. But to my great surprise, it was growing in an old dented, rusty bucket. I thought to myself, “If this were my plant, I’d put it in the loveliest container I had!” My friend changed my mind.“I ran short of pots,” she explained, “and knowing how beautiful this one would be, I thought it wouldn’t mind starting out in this old pail. It’s just for a little while, till I can put it out in the garden.”She must have wondered why I laughed so delightedly, but I was imagining just such a scene in heaven. “Here’s an especially beautiful one,” God might have said when he came to the soul of the sweet old fisherman. “He won’t mind starting in this small body.”​</a>

                                            How My Brother Leon Brought Home A Wife (Excerpt) By Manuel E. Arguilla She stepped down from the carretela of Ca Celin with quick, delicate grace. She was lovely. She was tall. She looked up to my brother with a smile, and her forehead was on a level with his mouth. "You are Baldo," she said and placed her hand ligh ly on my shoulder. Her nails were long, but they were not painted. She was fragrant like a morning when papayas are in bloom. And a smau aimpie appeared momenty nign on ner right cheek. "And this is Labing of whom I have heard so much." She held the wrist of one hand with the other and looked at Labang, and Laban; never stopped chewing his cud. He swallowed and brought up to his mouth more cud and the sound of his insides was like a drum. I laid a hand on labang's massive neck and said to her, "You may scratch his forehead now." She hesitated and I saw that her eyes were on the long, curving horns. But she came and touched Labang's forehead with her long fir gers, and Labang never stopped chewing his cud except that his big eyes are hal-closed. And by and by she was scratching his forehead very daintily. My brother Leon put down the two trunks on the grassy side of the road. He paid Ca Celin twice the usual tare from the station to the age of Nagrepcan. Inen he was standing beside us, and she turned to him eagerly. I watched Ca Celin, where he stood in front of his horse, and he ran his fingers through its forelock and could not keep his eyes away from her. "Maria---" brother Leon said. my He did not say Maring. He did not say Mayang. I knew then that he had always called her Maria and that to us all she would be Maria, and in my mind. I said 'Maria and it was a beautiful name. Directions: Get to know more of the character described in the story. Fill out the graphic organizer below. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.

                                            THE OLD FISHERMANOur house was directly across the street from the entrance of  a popular hospital in the city. We lived downstairs and rented the upstairs rooms to out patients at the clinic. One summer evening as I was fixing supper, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see a truly awful looking man.“Why, he’s hardly taller than my eight-year-old,” I thought as I stared at the stooped, shriveled body. But the appalling thing was his face–lopsided from swelling, red and raw. Yet his voice was pleasant as he said, “Good evening. I’ve come to see if you’ve a room for just one night. I came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore, and there’s no bus ’till the morning.”He told me he’d been hunting for a room since noon but he had no success as no one seemed to have a room. “I guess it’s my face. I know it looks terrible, but my doctor says with a few more treatments…”For a moment I hesitated, but his next words convinced me: “I could sleep in this rocking chair on the porch. My bus leaves early in the morning.” I told him we would find him a bed, but to rest on the porch.I went inside and finished getting supper. When we were ready, I asked the old man if he would join us “No thank you. I have plenty.” And he held up a brown paper bag. When I had finished the dishes, I went out on the porch to talk with him a few minutes.It didn’t take a long time to see that this old man had an oversized heart crowded into that tiny body. He told me he fished for a living to support his daughter, her five children, and her husband, who was hopelessly crippled from a back injury.He didn’t tell it by way of complaint; in fact, every other sentence was prefaced with a thanks to God for a blessing. He was grateful that no pain accompanied his disease, which was apparently a form of skin cancer. He thanked God for giving him the strength to keep going.At bedtime, we put a camp cot in the children’s room for him. When I got up in the morning, the bed linens were neatly folded and the little man was out on the porch. He refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, haltingly, as if asking a great favor, he said, “Could I please come back and stay the next time I have a treatment? I won’t put you out a bit. I can sleep fine in a chair.”He paused a moment and then added, “Your children made me feel at home. Grownups are bothered by my face, but children don’t seem to mind.” I told him he was welcome to come again.On his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and a quart of the largest oysters I had ever seen. He said he had shucked them that morning before he left so that they’d be nice and fresh. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us.In the years he came to stay overnight with us there was never a time that he did not bring us fish or oysters or vegetables from his garden. Other times we received packages in the mail, always by special delivery; fish and oysters packed in a box of fresh young spinach or kale, every leaf carefully washed.Knowing that he must walk three miles to mail these, and knowing how little money he had made the gifts more precious. When I received these little remembrances, I often thought of a comment our next-door neighbor made after he left that first morning. “Did you keep that awful looking man last night? I turned him away! You can lose roomers by putting up such people!”Maybe we did lose roomers once or twice. But oh! If only they could have known him, perhaps their illnesses would have been easier to bear. I know our family always will be grateful to have known him; from him we learned what it was to accept the bad without complaint and the good with gratitude.Recently I was visiting a friend who has a greenhouse. As she showed me her flowers, we came to the most beautiful one of all, a golden chrysanthemum, bursting with blooms. But to my great surprise, it was growing in an old dented, rusty bucket. I thought to myself, “If this were my plant, I’d put it in the loveliest container I had!” My friend changed my mind.“I ran short of pots,” she explained, “and knowing how beautiful this one would be, I thought it wouldn’t mind starting out in this old pail. It’s just for a little while, till I can put it out in the garden.”She must have wondered why I laughed so delightedly, but I was imagining just such a scene in heaven. “Here’s an especially beautiful one,” God might have said when he came to the soul of the sweet old fisherman. “He won’t mind starting in this small body.”​</a>

                                            The chosen song is "Scars To Your Beautiful" by Alessia Cara
Explanation:
Title: Who I am
The song Scars to Your Beautiful by Alessia Cara is all about self-acceptance. It gives you the motivation that you do not need to undergo several surgeries and physical changes to be accepted by society. This is one of the songs in my gallery that I can relate to. It is not based on love stories like most of the emerging pop songs and rap anthems.
One of the lines that greatly hit me is "She craves, attention she praises, an image , She prays to be". I admit that sometimes I tend to get insecure with myself. Sometimes, I get jealous of individuals who are so physically attractive. I tend to be insecure and want to be more than who I am today. I want to achieve glowing skin, healthy and pearly white teeth, a clear face, and attractive eyelashes.
Even if this song will be out of the most popular songs in the market, it will still be one of my favorites because it helped me understand how to appreciate myself for who I really am. I know I am not the only one who can relate to this because in our present time, most people will see what is on the outside more than what is on the inside.</a>

He was impressed by her courage and decided to teach her some magic tricks.As time went by, Lily learned more and more from Alaric, and they became close friends. She discovered that Alaric was actually a kind-hearted wizard who had been hiding from the world because he feared his power could be used for evil.One day, an evil sorcerer named Malakar arrived in the enchanted forest, and he was determined to destroy everything in his path. He had an army of dark creatures that obeyed his every command, and they began to terrorize the forest.Alaric and Lily knew they had to do something to stop Malakar, so they set out to gather the bravest warriors and wizards from all across the land. They formed a powerful army and marched into battle against Malakar and his minions.The battle was long and grueling, and it seemed like all hope was lost. But just when things were looking their bleakest, Lily remembered a spell that Alaric had taught her, and she used it to create a giant shield that protected the army from Malakar's attacks.With the shield in place, the army was able to regroup and launch a final attack against Malakar. Alaric used his most powerful magic to defeat the evil sorcerer, and the dark creatures disappeared back into the shadows.After the battle, Lily and Alaric were hailed as heroes, and they continued to teach magic to those who wished to learn. They became known as the protectors of the enchanted forest, and their legend lived on for generations to come.Question:1. What is the name of the wizard in the story?2. Where does Alaric live?3.

experience. Then answer the questions that follow. Choose the letter only and write

I just can’t help myself but to share to you a very beautiful
encounter I personally witnessed as I go to work.
You know, I have read a lot of posts in social media about cops
who become abusive of their power. One video that I watched
shows police brutality towards a bystander who allegedly
violated a protocol in this time of the pandemic. For not wearing
a mask, he was immediately detained. Others raged and asked
‘Could he be just fined?’ There was another
post about a ‘ginang’ who was accordingly detained after
having argued with a policeman. And many awkward and
untoward stories continue to surface that painted a bad image to our policemen.
I do not say that these stories are not true. But what I am pointing out here is
the fact that while some other policemen seem bad and abusive, majority of them
are not and are still working under their oath, that is to protect people from crimes.
One of the many good policemen happened to be the character of this good
encounter of mine.
I was on my way to work. It was difficult for me to flag down a taxi since it was
raining on that morning. I tried several times but the cabs could not just see me for
that part of the waiting shed was hidden by some trees plus the bad weather fog
seemed to darken that street. One, two, three, four times that I tried but still I could
not take one. I would be terribly late.
I was already hopeless when suddenly a police mobile came out from nowhere
and stopped at the side of the street. A man in uniform then came out from the car. I
guessed he was at his mid-40s.He had no umbrella but thank God the rain on that
moment wasn’t that hard to bathe him soon. He smiled at me and when he noticed
that a taxi was approaching, he made a sign for it to stop. It stopped. But what
surprised me and I didn’t expect more is when he took off his uniform and enveloped
me with it. So, I didn’t get moistened by rain as I got inside the cab. I thanked him for
his kindness and secretly read the name on his plate. ‘Macapagal, L.M.’ was
engraved on it. He nodded at me and assured that I owe nothing for his kindness.
He waved then as the car began to run. I will not forget that act of kindness.
When I reached home, I overheard our maids in the kitchen gigglingly talked
about a man who helped them carry their groceries after being stuck in the rain this
afternoon. According to Aling Carmen, our old maid, she would not surely forget the
name of that police guy for the rest of her life. As it was her first to receive such
kindness from a man of her dreams. But Aling Tessie, our jolly cook, teased Aling
Carmen that the police guy was only meant for herself and not for Aling Carmen.
And both of them giggled even more. When I asked them who this ‘knight with a
shining armor’ is they were talking about, both of them screamed ‘Macapagal, L.M!’
So, you see, it was the same guy who helped me earlier. Wow! It was just natural for that police guy to help! May many beautiful encounters continue to spread down the street!

She was tall. She looked up to my brother with a smile, and her forehead was on a level with his mouth. "You are Baldo," she said and placed her hand ligh ly on my shoulder.

"And this is Labing of whom I have heard so much." She held the wrist of one hand with the other and looked at Labang, and Laban; never stopped chewing his cud. He swallowed and brought up to his mouth more cud and the sound of his insides was like a drum. I laid a hand on labang's massive neck and said to her, "You may scratch his forehead now." She hesitated and I saw that her eyes were on the long, curving horns. But she came and touched Labang's forehead with her long fir gers, and Labang never stopped chewing his cud except that his big eyes are hal-closed.

                            25. THE OLD FISHERMANOur house was directly across the street from the entrance of  a popular hospital in the city. We lived downstairs and rented the upstairs rooms to out patients at the clinic. One summer evening as I was fixing supper, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see a truly awful looking man.“Why, he’s hardly taller than my eight-year-old,” I thought as I stared at the stooped, shriveled body. But the appalling thing was his face–lopsided from swelling, red and raw. Yet his voice was pleasant as he said, “Good evening. I’ve come to see if you’ve a room for just one night. I came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore, and there’s no bus ’till the morning.”He told me he’d been hunting for a room since noon but he had no success as no one seemed to have a room. “I guess it’s my face. I know it looks terrible, but my doctor says with a few more treatments…”For a moment I hesitated, but his next words convinced me: “I could sleep in this rocking chair on the porch. My bus leaves early in the morning.” I told him we would find him a bed, but to rest on the porch.I went inside and finished getting supper. When we were ready, I asked the old man if he would join us “No thank you. I have plenty.” And he held up a brown paper bag. When I had finished the dishes, I went out on the porch to talk with him a few minutes.It didn’t take a long time to see that this old man had an oversized heart crowded into that tiny body. He told me he fished for a living to support his daughter, her five children, and her husband, who was hopelessly crippled from a back injury.He didn’t tell it by way of complaint; in fact, every other sentence was prefaced with a thanks to God for a blessing. He was grateful that no pain accompanied his disease, which was apparently a form of skin cancer. He thanked God for giving him the strength to keep going.At bedtime, we put a camp cot in the children’s room for him. When I got up in the morning, the bed linens were neatly folded and the little man was out on the porch. He refused breakfast, but just before he left for his bus, haltingly, as if asking a great favor, he said, “Could I please come back and stay the next time I have a treatment? I won’t put you out a bit. I can sleep fine in a chair.”He paused a moment and then added, “Your children made me feel at home. Grownups are bothered by my face, but children don’t seem to mind.” I told him he was welcome to come again.On his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and a quart of the largest oysters I had ever seen. He said he had shucked them that morning before he left so that they’d be nice and fresh. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us.In the years he came to stay overnight with us there was never a time that he did not bring us fish or oysters or vegetables from his garden. Other times we received packages in the mail, always by special delivery; fish and oysters packed in a box of fresh young spinach or kale, every leaf carefully washed.Knowing that he must walk three miles to mail these, and knowing how little money he had made the gifts more precious. When I received these little remembrances, I often thought of a comment our next-door neighbor made after he left that first morning. “Did you keep that awful looking man last night? I turned him away! You can lose roomers by putting up such people!”Maybe we did lose roomers once or twice. But oh! If only they could have known him, perhaps their illnesses would have been easier to bear. I know our family always will be grateful to have known him; from him we learned what it was to accept the bad without complaint and the good with gratitude.Recently I was visiting a friend who has a greenhouse. As she showed me her flowers, we came to the most beautiful one of all, a golden chrysanthemum, bursting with blooms. But to my great surprise, it was growing in an old dented, rusty bucket. I thought to myself, “If this were my plant, I’d put it in the loveliest container I had!” My friend changed my mind.“I ran short of pots,” she explained, “and knowing how beautiful this one would be, I thought it wouldn’t mind starting out in this old pail. It’s just for a little while, till I can put it out in the garden.”She must have wondered why I laughed so delightedly, but I was imagining just such a scene in heaven. “Here’s an especially beautiful one,” God might have said when he came to the soul of the sweet old fisherman. “He won’t mind starting in this small body.”​</h2><br />

                            27. How My Brother Leon Brought Home A Wife (Excerpt) By Manuel E. Arguilla She stepped down from the carretela of Ca Celin with quick, delicate grace. She was lovely. She was tall. She looked up to my brother with a smile, and her forehead was on a level with his mouth. "You are Baldo," she said and placed her hand ligh ly on my shoulder. Her nails were long, but they were not painted. She was fragrant like a morning when papayas are in bloom. And a smau aimpie appeared momenty nign on ner right cheek. "And this is Labing of whom I have heard so much." She held the wrist of one hand with the other and looked at Labang, and Laban; never stopped chewing his cud. He swallowed and brought up to his mouth more cud and the sound of his insides was like a drum. I laid a hand on labang's massive neck and said to her, "You may scratch his forehead now." She hesitated and I saw that her eyes were on the long, curving horns. But she came and touched Labang's forehead with her long fir gers, and Labang never stopped chewing his cud except that his big eyes are hal-closed. And by and by she was scratching his forehead very daintily. My brother Leon put down the two trunks on the grassy side of the road. He paid Ca Celin twice the usual tare from the station to the age of Nagrepcan. Inen he was standing beside us, and she turned to him eagerly. I watched Ca Celin, where he stood in front of his horse, and he ran his fingers through its forelock and could not keep his eyes away from her. "Maria---" brother Leon said. my He did not say Maring. He did not say Mayang. I knew then that he had always called her Maria and that to us all she would be Maria, and in my mind. I said 'Maria and it was a beautiful name. Directions: Get to know more of the character described in the story. Fill out the graphic organizer below. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.

                            29. The chosen song is "Scars To Your Beautiful" by Alessia Cara
Explanation:
Title: Who I am
The song Scars to Your Beautiful by Alessia Cara is all about self-acceptance. It gives you the motivation that you do not need to undergo several surgeries and physical changes to be accepted by society. This is one of the songs in my gallery that I can relate to. It is not based on love stories like most of the emerging pop songs and rap anthems.
One of the lines that greatly hit me is "She craves, attention she praises, an image , She prays to be". I admit that sometimes I tend to get insecure with myself. Sometimes, I get jealous of individuals who are so physically attractive. I tend to be insecure and want to be more than who I am today. I want to achieve glowing skin, healthy and pearly white teeth, a clear face, and attractive eyelashes.
Even if this song will be out of the most popular songs in the market, it will still be one of my favorites because it helped me understand how to appreciate myself for who I really am. I know I am not the only one who can relate to this because in our present time, most people will see what is on the outside more than what is on the inside.</h2><br />

The sultana, who's pregnant, however, was lost in the woods. Out of fear, she gave birth and forgot about the baby when she left. Luckily, a merchant saw the baby and a bowl containing a live goldfish. The merchant realized that the life of the baby was attached to the live goldfish. If the fish leaves the water, the baby will die. The merchant adopted the baby. Later on, the baby grew up into a very beautiful young woman. In the loingdom, the king has just remarried a beautiful woman named Permaisuri. Permaisuri was afraid that the king will fall in love with someone else. When the queen found out about Bidasari, she wasbrought in the castle. There, she became a slave but Permaisuriwasn'tsatisfied. So, when she found out about the secret of Bidasari, she tookthe fish and made it into a necklace. Thus, Bidasari died and was put ina beautiful tomb located in the woods. One day, the king went hunting in the woods and saw the beautiful tomb. He went inside and saw Bidasari sleeping. The king waitedBidasari to wake up for two days. Meanwhile, in the palace, the queen was taking a bath and the fish managed to break free. Thus, Bidasari was awakened. The king talked to Bidasari and she told everything to the king.
