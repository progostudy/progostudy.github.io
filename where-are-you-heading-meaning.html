                                            Have you ever heard the sound of a hummingbird? They make a buzzing noise when they fly. They make this noise because they beat their wings so fast. They beat their wings up to 80 times a second. All that flapping makes a lot of noise. That's why we call them hummingbirds.Hummingbirds fly in a unique way. They move their wings so fast that they can hover. This means that they can stay in one spot in the middle of the air, like a helicopter. Sometimes they fly or hover upside down. They are the only bird that flies backward.Hummingbirds are small. One type called the bee hummingbird is the smallest bird in the world. Bee hummingbirds weigh less than a penny. They are just a little bit bigger than bees. I guess that's where they get their name. Bee hummingbirds build tiny nests. They use cobwebs and bits of bark to make their homes. Their homes are only an inch around. This is big enough for their eggs though. Their eggs are smaller than peas. People have found these tiny nests on a clothespin.Hummingbirds move fast. It takes lots of energy to move as fast as they do. This means that they need to eat a lot of food. Their favorite food is nectar, a sweet liquid inside of some flowers. They drink more than their own weight in nectar daily. They have to visit hundreds of flowers to get enough nectar to live. They can only store enough energy to survive through the night. They live on the edge.Hummingbirds don't use their long beaks like straws. They have a tongue just like you. They use their tongues for eating. They flick their tongues in and out of their mouths while inside of flowers. They lap up nectar. Flowers givethem the energy that they need.Hummingbirds help flowers too. They get pollen on their heads and bills when they feed. Flowers use pollen to make seeds. Hummingbirds help pollen get from one flower to the next. This helps flowers make more seeds. More seeds mean more flowers. More flowers mean more food for hummingbirds. Isn't it nice how that works out? where is the imformative text? ​</a>

Sang Kancil stepped on top of Sang Buaya's head and counted one. When he came to the second crocodile. Sang Kancil counted two and so to the rest of the line until he reached to the other side of the river. Sang Kancil turned to Sang Buaya and said. "Thank you. Sang Buaya for helping me to cross the river. This is my new home." "What do you mean? You tricked us to help you cross the river?" shouted Sang Buaya. He was shocked. "There isn't any feast. is there?" The other crocodiles looked at Sang Buaya angrily. They knew they had been tricked. After that.

                            15. Have you ever heard the sound of a hummingbird? They make a buzzing noise when they fly. They make this noise because they beat their wings so fast. They beat their wings up to 80 times a second. All that flapping makes a lot of noise. That's why we call them hummingbirds.Hummingbirds fly in a unique way. They move their wings so fast that they can hover. This means that they can stay in one spot in the middle of the air, like a helicopter. Sometimes they fly or hover upside down. They are the only bird that flies backward.Hummingbirds are small. One type called the bee hummingbird is the smallest bird in the world. Bee hummingbirds weigh less than a penny. They are just a little bit bigger than bees. I guess that's where they get their name. Bee hummingbirds build tiny nests. They use cobwebs and bits of bark to make their homes. Their homes are only an inch around. This is big enough for their eggs though. Their eggs are smaller than peas. People have found these tiny nests on a clothespin.Hummingbirds move fast. It takes lots of energy to move as fast as they do. This means that they need to eat a lot of food. Their favorite food is nectar, a sweet liquid inside of some flowers. They drink more than their own weight in nectar daily. They have to visit hundreds of flowers to get enough nectar to live. They can only store enough energy to survive through the night. They live on the edge.Hummingbirds don't use their long beaks like straws. They have a tongue just like you. They use their tongues for eating. They flick their tongues in and out of their mouths while inside of flowers. They lap up nectar. Flowers givethem the energy that they need.Hummingbirds help flowers too. They get pollen on their heads and bills when they feed. Flowers use pollen to make seeds. Hummingbirds help pollen get from one flower to the next. This helps flowers make more seeds. More seeds mean more flowers. More flowers mean more food for hummingbirds. Isn't it nice how that works out? where is the imformative text? ​</h2><br />

                            30. Mario: All right, so I didn't go drinking. Gloria: But your pay, what happened to it? Mario: It's better if you don't know, Gloria. Gloria: Look, Mario, I'm your wife. I have the right to half of everything you get. If I can't have my share, I have the right to know at least where it went! Marlo: All right (rises). I spent it all on another woman. Gloria: Another woman? I don't believe it. I know you wouldn't do such a thing. Marlo: I didn't know you had so much faith in me. Gloria: No, Mario! What I mean is, you wouldn't spend all your money when you know your daughter may need some of it. You love her too much to do that. (Mario sits down and buries his head in his hands. Gloria crosses to him and lays a hand on his shoulder.) Gloria: What's wrong, Mario? Marlo: (turns his face away) Nothing, Gloria, nothing. Gloria: (sits beside him) I know something is wrong, Mario. I can feel it. Tell me what it is. Marlo: (stares at the ground) Gloria, I've lost my job.guys pa help naman gumawa nag short poem yung kasya sa 60seconds na vids kasi mag portray kamiSubject:21st Literature ​</h2><br />
