Ogeinam Bowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilience are again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one is exempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently. Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy; but also on a lighter note, it came as a great global equalizer. This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and several universal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary. Our life, our wealth and all possessions we have, including our own skills and knowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even the most powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything is unpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation, we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go and our social connections and interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations and all things we hold dearly, with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftly becomes volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA world where all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change. And the very question is, "Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on the government, family and friends for help? As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More than ever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faith to a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps us going and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and huge changes in this "new normal". We all are caught off-guard, but with our faith, we continue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive at all times. We learn how to look at the brighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, our faith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life's challenges. Therefore, let us hold onto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble nor fear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of viruses such as this COVID-19.​</a>

Make your answer simple and direct to the point. Taft Avenue is a very busy part of Metro Manila. Since there is a fast- paced living in the area, it is possible that condominium living has been the trend for many due to the access it provides for inhabitants to go to business and education districts such as Manila, Quezon City, and Makati . The increase of condominiums around the area could also be a result of the density of people, predominantly students, given that De La Salle University, one of the country's top universities, is located along Taft Avenue. It is probable that most of these students would prefer condominium living rather than traveling from home to school and vice versa which, for the case of some, can be costly.

Ogeinam Bowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilience are again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one is exempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently. Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy; but also on a lighter note, it came as a great global equalizer. This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and several universal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary. Our life, our wealth and all possessions we have, including our own skills and knowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even the most powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything is unpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation, we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go and our social connections and interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations and all things we hold dearly, with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftly becomes volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA world where all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change. And the very question is, "Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on the government, family and friends for help? As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More than ever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faith to a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps us going and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and huge changes in this "new normal". We all are caught off-guard, but with our faith, we continue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive at all times. We learn how to look at the brighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, our faith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life's challenges. Therefore, let us hold onto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble nor fear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of viruses such as this COVID-19.​</h2><br />

I will love you as misfortune loves orphans, as fire loves innocence and as justice loves to sit and watch while everything goes wrong. I will love you as a battlefield loves young men and as peppermints love your allergies, and I will love you as the banana peel loves the shoe of a man who was just struck by a shingle falling off a house. I will love you as a volunteer fire department loves rushing into burning buildings and as burning buildings love to chase them back out, and as a parachute loves to leave a blimp and as a blimp operator loves to chase after it.I will love you as a dagger loves a certain person’s back, and as a certain person loves to wear dagger proof tunics, and as a dagger proof tunic loves to go to a certain dry cleaning facility, and how a certain employee of a dry cleaning facility loves to stay up late with a pair of binoculars, watching a dagger factory for hours in the hopes of catching a burglar, and as a burglar loves sneaking up behind people with binoculars, suddenly realizing that she has left her dagger at home.

I will love you until all such compartments are discovered and opened, and until all the secrets have gone gasping into the world. I will love you until all the codes and hearts have been broken and until every anagram and egg has been unscrambled.I will love you until every fire is extinguised and until every home is rebuilt from the handsomest and most susceptible of woods, and until every criminal is handcuffed by the laziest of policemen. I will love until M. hates snakes and J. hates grammar, and I will love you until C. realizes S. is not worthy of his love and N. realizes he is not worthy of the V. I will love you until the bird hates a nest and the worm hates an apple, and until the apple hates a tree and the tree hates a nest, and until a bird hates a tree and an apple hates a nest, although honestly I cannot imagine that last occurrence no matter how hard I try. I will love you as we grow older, which has just happened, and has happened again, and happened several days ago, continuously, and then several years before that, and will continue to happen as the spinning hands of every clock and the flipping pages of every calendar mark the passage of time, except for the clocks that people have forgotten to wind and the calendars that people have forgotten to place in a highly visible area. I will love you as we find ourselves farther and farther from one another, where we once we were so close that we could slip the curved straw, and the long, slender spoon, between our lips and fingers respectively.I will love you until the chances of us running into one another slip from slim to zero, and until your face is fogged by distant memory, and your memory faced by distant fog, and your fog memorized by a distant face, and your distance distanced by the memorized memory of a foggy fog. I will love you no matter where you go and who you see, no matter where you avoid and who you don’t see, and no matter who sees you avoiding where you go. I will love you no matter what happens to you, and no matter how I discover what happens to you, and no matter what happens to me as I discover this, and now matter how I am discovered after what happens to me as I am discovering this.Where is this from?​</h2><br />

Taft Avenue is a very busy part of Metro Manila. Since there is a fast- paced living in the area, it is possible that condominium living has been the trend for many due to the access it provides for inhabitants to go to business and education districts such as Manila, Quezon City, and Makati . The increase of condominiums around the area could also be a result of the density of people, predominantly students, given that De La Salle University, one of the country's top universities, is located along Taft Avenue. It is probable that most of these students would prefer condominium living rather than traveling from home to school and vice versa which, for the case of some, can be costly.
