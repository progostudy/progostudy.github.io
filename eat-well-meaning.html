                        <strong>PARAPHRASE THE SENTENCE</strong><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Biomass</strong> is plant or animal matter that has stored energy from the sun. Plants absorb energy from the sun to create chemical food for themselves as well as the animals that consume the plants, a process known as photosynthesis. Trees—the wood you burn in your fireplace in the winter to generate heat—are an example of biomass. In fact, the majority of biomass energy in the United States originates from wood, implying that all <strong>biomass</strong> energy can be traced back to the sun. <strong>Biomass</strong> is a type of sustainable biological material derived from plants and animals. Until the mid-1800s, <strong>biomass</strong> was the primary source of total yearly energy consumption in the United States. <strong>Biomass</strong> is a significant fuel in many nations, particularly in underdeveloped countries for cooking and heating. Many industrialized nations are boosting their use of biomass fuels for transportation and power generation in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel consumption. <strong>Biomass</strong> contributed roughly 5 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) in 2020, accounting for around 5% of total primary energy usage in the United States. <strong>Biomass</strong> is made up of chemical energy that has been stored from the sun. <strong>Biomass</strong> can be burned directly for heat or transformed into renewable liquid and gaseous fuels via a variety of processes.</p><p></p><p>Definition of biomass​</p><p>brainly.ph/question/13063532</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />
