                                            Biology indeed offered us great adventures as we learn greatly about life! It
teaches us to know how the traits were passed from parents to offspring. Also, it
helps us to realize that we are products of a very small biomolecule which is
scientifically known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This minute biomolecule serves
as the language for genetic interpretation and we exist on what we are and what we
should look like because of the codes printed in our DNA.
Due to the advent of modern technology, our knowledge about DNA goes
beyond from what we know about it before. Scientists and field experts can now enter
and modify the codes printed in our DNA. Does it sound like magic? It’s not magic,
it’s science! They can now manipulate the traits to produce new traits and expected
traits. Science indeed did not stop surprising us.
We live in a world where some fictions from sci – fi movies could possibly
become science. An example of this is a scientific study made by some physicians,
geneticists, and embryologists from United States, Japan, and Europe. Because of
their studies about preimplantation genetic diagnosis and gene – altering
technologies, you can now learn, as you become a parent, your child’s sex and
discover the traits they inherited and possessed as they grow up. Also, you can now
choose your children’s traits instead of leaving those traits in nature. Because of
these studies, physicians can now routinely test embryos of different donors for
hundreds of genes and use these embryos for soon – to – be – parents and child –
bearing – want – to – be – parents to pick embryos with genes that inhibit diseases
or to pick the sex of their future progeny.
So far so good, right? But behind these good benefits, the controversy is
swirling around gene – altering techniques that poses ethical and social dilemmas
that more and more people are now facing. And for all the issues surrounding gene
editing techniques, these scientific developments of modifying humankind should
prompt us to realize that science is no longer a thing that we know in the past or a
fictional stuff of the future. It is a reality that we must all now face.
In your point of view as a senior high school STEM student, should gene
editing be performed on human embryos? Is micromanipulation of gametes and
embryos helpful or can make a permanent change to society? Explain your answer
using the concepts that you have learned from this module.</a>

                                            Read the text below and identify at least five statements that are opinions or suggestions. / 10 A newborn baby can see, hear and feel. By the age of five, a child can talk, ride a bike and invent imaginary friends. How does this development happen? We don’t understand the way language, thinking and planning develop very well. Now scientists are using new technology to ‘see’ into children’s brains. And they seem to be discovering new information about the way a baby’s brain develops.A study in 2010 showed that the experiences a child has in their first few years affects the development of the brain. It showed that children who received more attention seemed to have higher IQs. The brain of a newborn baby has nearly a hundred billion neurons. This is the same number as an adult’s brain. As they grow, a baby receives information through the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. This information creates connections between different parts of the brain. At the age of three, there are a hundred trillion connections.One experiment looked at images of babies’ brains while they were listening to different sounds. The sounds were in different sequences. For example, one sequence was mu-ba-ba. This is the pattern ‘A-B-B’. Another sequence was mu-ba-ge. This is the pattern ‘A-B-C’. The images showed that the part of the brain responsible for speech seemed more active during ‘A-B-B’ patterns. This probably shows that babies can tell the difference between different patterns. This experiment is interesting because sequences of words are important to grammar and meaning. Compare two sentences with the same words in a different order: ‘John killed the bear’ is very different from ‘The bear killed John.’ So, it looks like that babies learn grammatical rules from the beginning of life.Researchers also know that babies need to hear a lot of language in order to understand grammar rules. But there is a big difference between listening to television, audio books or the internet, and interacting with people. One study compared two groups of nine-month-old American babies. One group watched videos of Mandarin Chinese sounds. In the other group, people spoke the same sounds to the babies. The test results showed that it is possible that the second group could recognize different sounds, however the first group learned nothing. The scientist, Patricia Kuhl, said this result was very surprising. It suggests that social experience is essential to successful brain development in babies. ​</a>

                            9. Biology indeed offered us great adventures as we learn greatly about life! It
teaches us to know how the traits were passed from parents to offspring. Also, it
helps us to realize that we are products of a very small biomolecule which is
scientifically known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This minute biomolecule serves
as the language for genetic interpretation and we exist on what we are and what we
should look like because of the codes printed in our DNA.
Due to the advent of modern technology, our knowledge about DNA goes
beyond from what we know about it before. Scientists and field experts can now enter
and modify the codes printed in our DNA. Does it sound like magic? It’s not magic,
it’s science! They can now manipulate the traits to produce new traits and expected
traits. Science indeed did not stop surprising us.
We live in a world where some fictions from sci – fi movies could possibly
become science. An example of this is a scientific study made by some physicians,
geneticists, and embryologists from United States, Japan, and Europe. Because of
their studies about preimplantation genetic diagnosis and gene – altering
technologies, you can now learn, as you become a parent, your child’s sex and
discover the traits they inherited and possessed as they grow up. Also, you can now
choose your children’s traits instead of leaving those traits in nature. Because of
these studies, physicians can now routinely test embryos of different donors for
hundreds of genes and use these embryos for soon – to – be – parents and child –
bearing – want – to – be – parents to pick embryos with genes that inhibit diseases
or to pick the sex of their future progeny.
So far so good, right? But behind these good benefits, the controversy is
swirling around gene – altering techniques that poses ethical and social dilemmas
that more and more people are now facing. And for all the issues surrounding gene
editing techniques, these scientific developments of modifying humankind should
prompt us to realize that science is no longer a thing that we know in the past or a
fictional stuff of the future. It is a reality that we must all now face.
In your point of view as a senior high school STEM student, should gene
editing be performed on human embryos? Is micromanipulation of gametes and
embryos helpful or can make a permanent change to society? Explain your answer
using the concepts that you have learned from this module.</h2><br />
                        <p>The cell is the basic unit of life. All organisms are composed of one or more cells. As will be discussed later, humans are made up of many millions of cells. In order to understand what goes wrong in cancer, it is important to understand how normal cells work. The first step is to discuss the structure and basic functions of cells.</p><p></p><p>First we will introduce the common building blocks of cells. All cells, regardless of their function or location in the body, share common features and processes. Amazingly, cells are comprised almost entirely of just four basic types of molecules. Shown above is a cell surrounded by examples of these building block molecules.</p><p></p><p>Since they are present in living things these building blocks are called biomolecules. The next sections describe the structures and functions of each of these basic building blocks.

                            17. Read the text below and identify at least five statements that are opinions or suggestions. / 10 A newborn baby can see, hear and feel. By the age of five, a child can talk, ride a bike and invent imaginary friends. How does this development happen? We don’t understand the way language, thinking and planning develop very well. Now scientists are using new technology to ‘see’ into children’s brains. And they seem to be discovering new information about the way a baby’s brain develops.A study in 2010 showed that the experiences a child has in their first few years affects the development of the brain. It showed that children who received more attention seemed to have higher IQs. The brain of a newborn baby has nearly a hundred billion neurons. This is the same number as an adult’s brain. As they grow, a baby receives information through the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. This information creates connections between different parts of the brain. At the age of three, there are a hundred trillion connections.One experiment looked at images of babies’ brains while they were listening to different sounds. The sounds were in different sequences. For example, one sequence was mu-ba-ba. This is the pattern ‘A-B-B’. Another sequence was mu-ba-ge. This is the pattern ‘A-B-C’. The images showed that the part of the brain responsible for speech seemed more active during ‘A-B-B’ patterns. This probably shows that babies can tell the difference between different patterns. This experiment is interesting because sequences of words are important to grammar and meaning. Compare two sentences with the same words in a different order: ‘John killed the bear’ is very different from ‘The bear killed John.’ So, it looks like that babies learn grammatical rules from the beginning of life.Researchers also know that babies need to hear a lot of language in order to understand grammar rules. But there is a big difference between listening to television, audio books or the internet, and interacting with people. One study compared two groups of nine-month-old American babies. One group watched videos of Mandarin Chinese sounds. In the other group, people spoke the same sounds to the babies. The test results showed that it is possible that the second group could recognize different sounds, however the first group learned nothing. The scientist, Patricia Kuhl, said this result was very surprising. It suggests that social experience is essential to successful brain development in babies. ​</h2><br />
