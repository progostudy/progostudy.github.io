                                            4. Sleep is more important than most of us realize. Studies have shown that getting enough sleep helps us pay attention, learn and remember things more easily, and generally feel better as we go through our day. There is some debate over whether soft or firm pillows lead to the best sleep. Consistent, high-quality sleep is crucial for our bodies to heal and repair from our daily activities. Even though it might seem fun to stay up late, we usually pay for it the next day by feeling tired and cranky. The better we sleep, the better prepared we are to take on each day!​</a>

                            4. Learning Task 2Persuasive writing states and supports an opinion. Based on the givenstatements, write your own persuasive text using the structure (1+3BR+C).Some people think recesses in school should be longer. They believe kids mightleam better if they had a longer break in the middle of the day. However, the extraclass time after recess would make the school day longer. Therefore, kids wouldget out of school later in the day. What do you think? Support your opinion withpersuasive writing.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One reason why recess should be longer is that kids need to be more physical to have healthier bodies. With more recess, kids might get a lot more flexible! Kids will get really good at sports too, which is a very important skill. Tag, soccer, football, climbing - now that's physical!</p><p></p><p>Kids also really need to play! An important part of childhood is having fun, and kids can't really play longer more interesting games with just 15 minutes of recess. Longer recess will help kids be more creative when they come up with games and activities to fill the time. Kids would even learn to get along more with a longer recess. They would have time to talk and solve problems. Kids who get bored or have a tough time in class will feel good about school when they have recess.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, with more recess kids will do better with their school work. That sounds like the opposite, but it's true. With more recess, kids would let all their energy out in recess time. Kids will be really quiet and focused in class all because of recess. Kids will not run in the classroom or ever fool around again.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps! goodluck</p><br />

3. "Every day, every night, in every way, I am getting better and better."</h2><br />

Men sell the wedding bells - This is a metaphor. A metaphor is a figure of speech that compares two things without using the word "like" or "as." In this case, the speaker is comparing men to wedding bells, suggesting that men have some qualities or characteristics in common with wedding bells.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2. Speech is silver, but silence is gold. - This is a simile. A simile is a figure of speech that compares two things using the words "like" or "as." In this case, the speaker is saying that speech is like silver and silence is like gold, implying that both are valuable in different ways.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. "Every day, every night, in every way, I am getting better and better." - This is an example of repetition. The phrase "every day, every night, in every way" is repeated for emphasis, and the overall structure of the sentence follows a pattern of repetition as well.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><br />

                            22. 4. Sleep is more important than most of us realize. Studies have shown that getting enough sleep helps us pay attention, learn and remember things more easily, and generally feel better as we go through our day. There is some debate over whether soft or firm pillows lead to the best sleep. Consistent, high-quality sleep is crucial for our bodies to heal and repair from our daily activities. Even though it might seem fun to stay up late, we usually pay for it the next day by feeling tired and cranky. The better we sleep, the better prepared we are to take on each day!​</h2><br />

                            28. Learning Task 2 Persuasive writing states and supports an opinion. Based on the given statements, write your own persuasive text using the structure (I+3BR+C). Some people think recesses in school should be longer. They believe kids might learn better if they had a longer break in the middle of the day. However, the extra class time after recess would make the school day longer. Therefore, kids would get out of school later in the day. What do you think? Support your opinion with persuasive writing.​</h2><br />
                        <p>Learning Task 2: </p><p>Recess has indeed been significant upon every student, it is beneficial especially when students need to rest and break free from stress and get some fresh air while filling up their stomach from hunger. Every student  needs to rest their brain to help them think correctly, in order to have a piece of mind. We all know with the standard, "wake up early - school for hours - assignments at home" routine of most students. Without a doubt, students haven't got enough rest nor time to process every lesson they tackle. So why not give them a little more time to have their recess properly? Research shows that when children have recess, they gain improved memory and be more focused attention, which thus develop more brain connections.</p><p>Having more time in recess means that they will have more time to eat their food too, right? By having enough time, their body will no longer be overwhelmed by how fast they consume their food, thus getting a balanced and healthier bodies. Children might even get a lot more active and flexible! They will for sure enjoy sports and other physical activities too since they had their meal properly without rushing it. It is beneficial for students to be more creative when they come up with games and activities to fill the time.  </p><p>Longer recess time means longer school hours but favorably, I think school hours will no longer need to be affected since long recess time means they will have time to recharge and will undoubtedly become much more active on tasks. They wouldn't take up much time on figuring things out within school hours, for instance; recitation, group activities, individual reporting—wouldn't it be more advisable if your student won't take much time upon fidgeting or stuttering during reporting because they already had time to prepare theirselves on recess? With good mentally state for the students they can enjoy and will be more focused in the class even and study effectively!</p><p>Lastly, if students get to hang out even just for a while after a long period discussion, they can have fun and socialize such as sharing and talking about their favorite snacks etc. Children will no longer have to bother being noisy and gossiping throughout the class due to the fact that they already had the time to interact during recess time, which gave them the chance to let their energy and thoughts out. They will not fill the classroom with noised and won't fool around each other. Who wouldn't want a quite and focused students while teaching? Less stress.</p><p>In summarize everything that has been stated, it is only reasonable to make the recess  longer since it positively impacts mental state makes the learning environment fresher in a way. We shouldn't put pressure into them, so that they can fullfill their daily task properly without distractions.  With these reasons gathered and discussed, children will have the  time to regain their energy. Learning is made to be fun and giving them longer recces will help their brain function properly and will have the ability to focus their goals. There is no way that making the recess longer is such a bad decision to do so. This will significantly make it convenient not just for the students, but  for everyone as well.</p><br />
