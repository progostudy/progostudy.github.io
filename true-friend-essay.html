Peer Pressure
We often hear about the dangers of peer pressure to teenagers. Teenagers take drugs, skip school, get drunk, or have sex because their friends do these things. However, there is another—perhaps equally bad—effect of peer pressure. Desperate to conform to their friends' values, teens may give up their interests in school, in hobbies, and even in certain people.
Teenagers may, first of all, lose or hide their interest in school in order to be like their friends. They adopt a negative attitude in which school is seen as a battlefield, with teachers and other officials regarded as the enemy. In addition, teenagers may stop participating in class. It is no longer cool to raise a hand or seem anxious to learn. It is cool to show up without the assigned homework. Conforming also means not joining many after-school activities. A teenager might be curious about the band, the Spanish club, the student council, or the computer club but does not dare join if the gang feels such activities are for squares.
Teenagers also give up private pleasures and hobbies to be one of the crowd. Certain pastimes, such as writing poems, practicing piano, reading books, or fooling around with a chemistry set may be off-limits because the crowd laughs at them. So, teens often drop these interests or exchange them for riding around in cars and hanging out at the mall. Even worse, teens have to give up their own values and mock the people who stay interested in such hobbies. Against their better instincts, they label as "creeps" the girl who is always reading books or the boy who spends after-school time in the biology lab. Most important, giving up private pleasure during these years can mean that the teenager loses these interests forever. It may only be as an adult that the person wishes he or she had kept up with piano, ballet, or astronomy—and feels it is now too late to start again.
Finally, teenagers sometimes give up the people they love in order to be accepted. If necessary, they sacrifice the old friend who no longer dresses well enough, listens to the right kind of music, or refuses to drink or take drugs. Potential boyfriends and girlfriends may be rejected, too, if the crowd doesn't like their looks or values. Sadly, teenagers can even cut their families out of their lives. They may be ashamed of the parents who are too poor, too conventional, too different from friends' parents. Even if the teens are not completely ashamed of their parents, they may still refuse to participate in family get-togethers or spend time with younger brothers or sisters.
It is true that many teenagers face the pressures of being forced to take drugs, to perform dangerous stunts, to do risky things. But a more common and perhaps more painful pressure is to conform to the crowd by giving up part of oneself. Attachments to learning, to special interests, and to special people are often thrown away must to "be one of the guys."

This sentence is in the active voice: “Topics for the next essay are being considered by the students.” 7.The underlined part of this sentence is the doer of the action: “The children were advised to drink milk instead of soda." 8. The following sentence is in the passive voice: “The essay was written by Shiela.” 9. In the sentence, “Shiela wrote the essay", the transitive verb is wrote. 10.

Peer Pressure
We often hear about the dangers of peer pressure to teenagers. Teenagers take drugs, skip school, get drunk, or have sex because their friends do these things. However, there is another—perhaps equally bad—effect of peer pressure. Desperate to conform to their friends' values, teens may give up their interests in school, in hobbies, and even in certain people.
Teenagers may, first of all, lose or hide their interest in school in order to be like their friends. They adopt a negative attitude in which school is seen as a battlefield, with teachers and other officials regarded as the enemy. In addition, teenagers may stop participating in class. It is no longer cool to raise a hand or seem anxious to learn. It is cool to show up without the assigned homework. Conforming also means not joining many after-school activities. A teenager might be curious about the band, the Spanish club, the student council, or the computer club but does not dare join if the gang feels such activities are for squares.
Teenagers also give up private pleasures and hobbies to be one of the crowd. Certain pastimes, such as writing poems, practicing piano, reading books, or fooling around with a chemistry set may be off-limits because the crowd laughs at them. So, teens often drop these interests or exchange them for riding around in cars and hanging out at the mall. Even worse, teens have to give up their own values and mock the people who stay interested in such hobbies. Against their better instincts, they label as "creeps" the girl who is always reading books or the boy who spends after-school time in the biology lab. Most important, giving up private pleasure during these years can mean that the teenager loses these interests forever. It may only be as an adult that the person wishes he or she had kept up with piano, ballet, or astronomy—and feels it is now too late to start again.
Finally, teenagers sometimes give up the people they love in order to be accepted. If necessary, they sacrifice the old friend who no longer dresses well enough, listens to the right kind of music, or refuses to drink or take drugs. Potential boyfriends and girlfriends may be rejected, too, if the crowd doesn't like their looks or values. Sadly, teenagers can even cut their families out of their lives. They may be ashamed of the parents who are too poor, too conventional, too different from friends' parents. Even if the teens are not completely ashamed of their parents, they may still refuse to participate in family get-togethers or spend time with younger brothers or sisters.
It is true that many teenagers face the pressures of being forced to take drugs, to perform dangerous stunts, to do risky things. But a more common and perhaps more painful pressure is to conform to the crowd by giving up part of oneself. Attachments to learning, to special interests, and to special people are often thrown away must to "be one of the guys."

Making and Keeping Friends 
Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other's happiness and supporting each other when times are tough.
A lot of friends have things in common so it's easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can Per even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. 
Showing you care about the other person's happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends' faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. 
Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don't know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it's uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it's nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that's when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. 
Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care

You copy and pasted it into one great essay, complete with pictures and other visuals. You did not cite your references in order to impress your perfectionist and strict teacher. 2. A family friend, who also happens to be your classmate in one of your classes was diagnosed with an incurable illness. Your close family ties enabled you to know the status of her health, including its severity, and asked you to refrain from spilling out the information outside of your family circle. In order to help her with her absences and academic standing, you told your class adviser about her health status. 3. You are living in a peaceful community within your barangay where everyone practically knows everyone. Lately, there have been rumors circulating around the neighborhood that one of your friends is into illegal drugs. Upon investigation and personal interview, you found out that he is actually using marijuana because of an emotional problem within his family. You decided to help him by enlisting the help of psychologists and authorities in order to help him rehabilitate and cope with the problem. True enough, he was sent to a rehabilitation center in order to undergo debriefing. The news spread like wildfire within the neighborhood and soon, his family’s problems was then discussed out in the open. Your friend’s family have branded you a traitor for helping the “arrest” of your friend and ultimately revealing their problems to the entire neighborhood.​</a>

diagnosed with an incurable illness. Your close family ties enabled you to know the

Lately, there have been rumors circulating around the neighborhood that one of your friends is into illegal drugs.

You decided to help him by enlisting the help of psychologists and authorities in order to help him rehabilitate and cope with the problem.

The news spread like wildfire within the neighborhood and soon, his family’s problems was then discussed out in the open.

                            1. the true friends are hard to find. why?essay 350 words​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>True friends are rare and valuable, and it is not always easy to find them. This is because true friendship requires certain qualities and characteristics that are not common in everyone. These qualities are trust, loyalty, empathy, and support, and they are essential for building and maintaining a strong and lasting friendship.</p><p></p><p>Trust is a vital component of any friendship. A true friend is someone who we can trust completely, who will keep our secrets, and who will always be honest with us. However, trust takes time to build, and it can be difficult to know who we can trust. Many people are guarded and closed off, and it can be hard to get past their defenses and develop a sense of trust.</p><p></p><p>Loyalty is another important quality of a true friend. Loyalty means standing by someone no matter what, being there for them through thick and thin, and never betraying their trust. It is not easy to find someone who is truly loyal, as many people are fickle and unreliable.</p><p></p><p>Empathy is also crucial in a friendship. A true friend is someone who can put themselves in our shoes, understand our feelings and emotions, and provide support when we need it. Empathy is not something that everyone possesses, and it can be challenging to find someone who truly understands and cares about us.</p><p></p><p>Finally, support is essential in a friendship. A true friend is someone who will always be there for us, offering a helping hand or a listening ear when we need it. They will celebrate our successes with us and offer a shoulder to cry on during tough times. Support requires effort and commitment, and it is not something that everyone is willing or able to provide.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, true friends are hard to find because they possess qualities such as trust, loyalty, empathy, and support that are not common in everyone. Building a strong and lasting friendship requires time, effort, and commitment, and it is not always easy to find someone who is willing and able to invest in a friendship in this way. However, the rewards of having a true friend are immeasurable, and it is worth the effort to seek out and nurture these important relationships.</p><p>Another reason why true friends are hard to find is that trust, loyalty, and mutual respect are essential components of a genuine friendship, and these qualities are not always easy to come by. It takes time and experience to build trust and establish a strong bond with someone, and not everyone is willing or able to invest that kind of effort into a friendship.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, true friends are hard to find because they require a certain level of vulnerability and emotional openness. To truly connect with another person, one must be willing to share their thoughts, feelings, and vulnerabilities, which can be uncomfortable or even scary for some people. For many individuals, it is easier to keep their guard up and maintain a superficial relationship rather than risking emotional intimacy and true connection.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, true friends are indeed hard to find, but that does not mean that they do not exist. While building and maintaining a genuine friendship requires time, effort, and vulnerability, the rewards of having a true friend are immeasurable. A true friend is someone who supports, encourages, and challenges us to be the best version of ourselves, and they make our lives richer, happier, and more fulfilling</p><br />

Peer Pressure
We often hear about the dangers of peer pressure to teenagers. Teenagers take drugs, skip school, get drunk, or have sex because their friends do these things. However, there is another—perhaps equally bad—effect of peer pressure. Desperate to conform to their friends' values, teens may give up their interests in school, in hobbies, and even in certain people.
Teenagers may, first of all, lose or hide their interest in school in order to be like their friends. They adopt a negative attitude in which school is seen as a battlefield, with teachers and other officials regarded as the enemy. In addition, teenagers may stop participating in class. It is no longer cool to raise a hand or seem anxious to learn. It is cool to show up without the assigned homework. Conforming also means not joining many after-school activities. A teenager might be curious about the band, the Spanish club, the student council, or the computer club but does not dare join if the gang feels such activities are for squares.
Teenagers also give up private pleasures and hobbies to be one of the crowd. Certain pastimes, such as writing poems, practicing piano, reading books, or fooling around with a chemistry set may be off-limits because the crowd laughs at them. So, teens often drop these interests or exchange them for riding around in cars and hanging out at the mall. Even worse, teens have to give up their own values and mock the people who stay interested in such hobbies. Against their better instincts, they label as "creeps" the girl who is always reading books or the boy who spends after-school time in the biology lab. Most important, giving up private pleasure during these years can mean that the teenager loses these interests forever. It may only be as an adult that the person wishes he or she had kept up with piano, ballet, or astronomy—and feels it is now too late to start again.
Finally, teenagers sometimes give up the people they love in order to be accepted. If necessary, they sacrifice the old friend who no longer dresses well enough, listens to the right kind of music, or refuses to drink or take drugs. Potential boyfriends and girlfriends may be rejected, too, if the crowd doesn't like their looks or values. Sadly, teenagers can even cut their families out of their lives. They may be ashamed of the parents who are too poor, too conventional, too different from friends' parents. Even if the teens are not completely ashamed of their parents, they may still refuse to participate in family get-togethers or spend time with younger brothers or sisters.
It is true that many teenagers face the pressures of being forced to take drugs, to perform dangerous stunts, to do risky things. But a more common and perhaps more painful pressure is to conform to the crowd by giving up part of oneself. Attachments to learning, to special interests, and to special people are often thrown away must to "be one of the guys."

Making and Keeping Friends 
Making and keeping friends is fun, but it also takes effort Some people think that making and keeping friends is natural and requires nothing but hanging out and having fun. True friendships involve sharing parts of your lives with each other, showing that you care about each other's happiness and supporting each other when times are tough.
A lot of friends have things in common so it's easy to share parts of their life with the other person. For example, if both like drawing or Legos, then they can do that together and share their creations. They can Per even create together! Sometimes sharing parts of your life is simply telling the other person what is going on in your life and keeping in touch. 
Showing you care about the other person's happiness is another important part of being friends. Sometimes people do nice things to put a smile on their friends' faces. Another common way to make your friends happy is to make them laugh. Sometimes, when they are down, just showing you care is enough to make them feel better. 
Being there for friends when times really get tough is the hardest part of being friends. Sometimes people don't know what to do or say when their friends are hurting, so it's uncomfortable. A hurting friend usually just needs someone to listen, but sometimes it's nice to help them think about their problem and generate a solution. There are also times when they are down because a friend hurt them and that's when that friend needs to apologize and ask how to make it better. 
Having fun with someone is easy, but friendship takes time and effort. You have to take care of your relationship like you would take care of a plant. People need to feel connected to their friends and know that they care

Thereare a lot of different types of exercise you can do such as basketball, water-skiingand dance and, what's more, you can play them in the comfort of your own home.In my opinion, these games are fun and interactive because you can play them withfriends and, if you play online, you don't need to be in same place as your friend toplay.In addition, you can play them whenever you want. Some people think thatit's better to do exercise outside in the fresh air.

2. A family friend, who also happens to be your classmate in one of your classes was
diagnosed with an incurable illness. Your close family ties enabled you to know the
status of her health, including its severity, and asked you to refrain from spilling out the information outside of your family circle. In order to help her with her absences and academic standing, you told your class adviser about her health status.
3. You are living in a peaceful community within your barangay where everyone practically knows everyone. Lately, there have been rumors circulating around the neighborhood that one of your friends is into illegal drugs. Upon investigation and personal interview, you found out that he is actually using marijuana because of an emotional problem within his family. You decided to help him by enlisting the help of psychologists and authorities in order to help him rehabilitate and cope with the problem. True enough, he was sent to a rehabilitation center in order to undergo debriefing. The news spread like wildfire within the neighborhood and soon, his family’s problems was then discussed out in the open. Your friend’s family have branded you a traitor for helping the “arrest” of your friend and ultimately revealing their problems to the entire neighborhood.</h2><br />
