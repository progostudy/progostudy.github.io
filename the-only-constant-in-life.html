Likewise, it contributes to the betterment of your mental health. 2. Listening to your sibling and adjusting your behavior to address his/her concerns can help you both in growing up. In the same way, giving and taking favors to and from each would make your relationship even stronger. 3. Followers of Islam believe that there is only one God in existence. In like manner, Christianity is also a monotheistic religion. 4. India is an undeniably beautiful country with a rich heritage and vibrant culture. Nevertheless, the country's reputation has been tarnished over the years due to its rampant corruption problems. 5. People of the Christian faith strongly believe in the afterlife while Hindus and Buddhists preach the concept of reincarnation and nirvana. 6.

Factors that make a planet habitableFactors thatmake aPlanetHabitableNot Enough of the FactorJust RightToo Much of the FactorSituation in the Solar SystemTemperature influences how quickly atoms and molecules move.Low temperatures cause chemicals to react slowly, which interferes with the reactions necessary for life. It can also cause the freezing of water, making liquid water unavailable.Life seems to be limited to a temperature range of -15oC to 115oC. In this range, liquid water can still exist under certain conditions.At about 125oC, protein and carbohydrate molecules, and the genetic material (e.g., DNA and RNA) start to break apart. Also, high temperatures cause the quick evaporation of water.Surface: only the Earth’s surface is in this temperature range. Sub-surface: the interior of the solid planets and moons may be in this temperature range.AtmosphereSmall planets and moons have insufficient gravity to hold an atmosphere. The gas molecules escape to space, leaving the planet or moon without an insulating blanket or a protective shield.Earth and Venus are the right size to hold a sufficientatmosphere. Earth’s atmosphere is about 100 miles thick. It keeps the surface warm and protects it from radiation and small- to mediumsized meteorites.Venus’s atmosphere is 100 times thicker than Earth’s. It is made almost entirely of greenhouse gasses, making the surface too hot for life. The four giant planets are completely made of gas.Of the solid planets and moons, only Earth, Venus, and Titan have significant atmospheres. Mars’ atmosphere is about 1/100th that of Earth’s, too small for significant insulation or shielding.EnergyWhen there is too little sunlight or too few of the chemicals that provide energy to cells, such as iron or sulfur, organisms die.With a steady input of either light or chemical energy, cells can run the chemical reactions necessary for life.Light energy is a problem if it makes a planet too hot or if there are too many harmful rays, such as ultraviolet. Too many energy-rich chemicals is not a problemSurface: The inner planets get too much sunlight for life. The outer planets get too little. Sub-surface: Most solid planets and moons have energy-rich chemicals.Nutrients used to build and maintain an organism’s body.Without chemicals to make proteins and carbohydrates, organisms cannot grow. Planets without systems to deliver nutrients to its organisms (e.g., a water cycle or volcanic activity) cannot support life. Also, when nutrients are spread so thin that they are hard to obtain, such as on a gas planet, life cannot exist.All solid planets and moons have the same general chemical makeup, so nutrients are present. Those with a water cycle or volcanic activity can transport and replenish the chemicals required by living organisms.Too many nutrients are not a problem. However, too active a circulation system, such as the constant volcanism on Jupiter’s moon, Io, or the churning atmospheres of the gas planets, interferes with an organism’s ability to get enough nutrients.Surface: Earth has a water cycle, an atmosphere, and volcanoes to circulate nutrients. Venus, Titan, Io, and Mars have nutrients and ways to circulate them to organisms. Sub-surface: Any planet or moon with sub-surface water or molten rock can circulate and replenish nutrients for organismsFactors that make a planet habitable. National Science Question:1. What are the factors that make the planet habitable? 2. What are the characteristics of planet Earth that makes it habitable?​</a>

                                            Life feels like a massive rehearsal for every person you have to talk to, for every situation you have to attend,which just falls apart into wild swings of arrogance and timidity.Growing up didn't help with the awkwardness. There were just so many opportunities lost because I justcould not get what was before me - how I should react to it or deal with it.But growing up helped with coping. Even when an interaction is just a pile of your actions shattering into"Huh?" or "What?" or that other person's stare of bewilderment with matching eyebrows raised the best wayto deal with it is to not dwell on it too much.You are doing fine even when you are all over the place, because the mistakes you earn and the memories ofembarrassments past help in some way to try again and get it right with the right person.[...] And what growing up taught me most is that people come and go; what matters is the memories you hadwith them when they stayed You are the constant in this coming and going, so what will always matter is thatyou become a better person than yourself, and that you find mearing in all this clumsy struggling. You justhave to build value, either through becoming more well-adjusted or just becoming more skilled or justkeeping yourself going through the day.Excerpt from The Awkward Years by Ace Alba+1. in which paragraph expresses the main idea that encounter and engagement with people seems like a trialand error experience?A. paragraph 1B. paragraph 2C. paragraph 4D. paragraph 52.Which statement best summarizes the passage?A Entering adulthood is a time when people charge mistake as learning and deal with all sorts of uneasinessin one's lifeB.

                                            What Is Education and Why Is It Important? By Ananya Mahapatra Source: https://www.atg.world/view-article/IMPORTANCEOFEDUCATION-70 Education is a learning experience where an individual learns about various aspects of life, understands the different perspectives and tries to apply it in daily life. Education is important to the children, to adults and to the society. Education gives people knowledge of the world around them and changes it into something better. It develops in people a perspective of looking at life, helps them build opinions and have points of view on things in life. Mahatma Gandhi once quoted, "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." This portrays the importance of education and leaming in one's life. If a child is joined in a school, he will start leaming, playing and enjoy with friends. While leaming he will understand what position he is in acquiring knowledge and he will leam slowly to grab the top position.

                                            DISTURBACES IN ESTUARIES          Estuaries are partially enclosed coastal bodies of water where rivers meet the sea.They are homes to unique plants and animals that have adapted to brackish water-mixture fresh water draining from the land and salty seawater. Numerous marine species use the nutrient – rich and sheltered estuaries as nurserygrounds.          Some fish species not only migrate between the waters of the various oceans and seas, but also require migrating between freshwaters and the marine waters. Such fishes, which spend part of their life-cycle in salt-water and a part in freshwater, are called diadromous fishes, e.g. the eel fish, the salmon, and the trout. These include the anadromousspecies which migrate from the sea to freshwater for spawning (process oflaying eggs), and the catadromous species, which spawn in the ocean or at sea, and migrate towards freshwater as juveniles. The regions in many coastal areas are highly disturbed today due to constant disturbance from the mainland in the form of pollution—pesticidal pollution, discharge from sewage system, silt, and etc. Such disturbances in the estuarine and coastal areas make migration of diadromous fishes to their spawning areas difficult, and adversely affect their populations by acting as the major blockage in the lifecycle of these species.A.

Bowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilience are again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one is exempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently, Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy, but also on a lighter note, it came as a great global equalizer. This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and several universal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary. Our life, our wealth and all possessions we have, including our own skills and knowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even the most powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything is unpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation, we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go and our social connections and interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations and all things we hold dearly, with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftly becomes volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA world where all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change. And the very question is, 'Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on the government, family and friends for help? As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More than ever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faith to a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps us going and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and huge changes in this "new normal". We all are caught ofl-guard, but with our faith, we continue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive at all times. We learn how to look at the brighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, our faith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life's challenges. Therefore, let us hold onto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble nor fear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of viruses such as this COVID-19.​</a>

                                            Exercise 5. Read the excerpt and do the activities that follow. I am Juan Picas, born half of myself. I had only one eye, one ear, one arm, one leg, one half of a body. My mother wept when she saw me, but loved me as I grew up and never regarded me as abnormal. My father, too, must have wept although he never spoke of this. He also took me as I was and loved me as much as he knew how. I grew in their care; I thrived in their love. As far as I knew I was entire, I thought myself whole. Like all babies, I learned first to smile, and then to coo, to babble, and to know my mother and father, too. I learned to crawl, and sit up and, in time, to doodle. I learned to speak but even before that, I learned to laugh. My mother taught me how to laugh, perhaps even before I learned to cry. She showered me with good cheer, constant delight. She taught me how to sing. My father taught me how to see. The birds of the sky, the trees, the flowers that grew, the rains that fell and the winds that roared in the night – these my father spoke of and made me see how perfect they fitted into our world and made it as lovely as can be. My father also spoke of people, saying that they are on this earth and living this life as a test. All that matters is a life spent doing good. A man should apply his days in work and by his hands hone his heart in service to God and his fellowmen. Less than his intent and in labor done, a man’s days are but in vain. My father said this, and I realized how he directed his days and wished my life to be. My father often spoke of God as did my mother. The father in Heaven who made us and whose love will keep us alive. God orders our days from our birth, through our youth and manhood, through age and through death and after life. He has the whole world in His hands, rules the beatings of our hearts, knows the number of our hair, and loves us in everything whether good or ill befalls us. All of life’s road lead to him; and answers to life’s questions lie in Him. The meaning of life is with Him. My father and mother taught me this and I learned it. So I grew, a happy child swathed in kindness. My parents sheltered me and kept me away from prying eyes. I did not know harshness, cruelty, even less, until as a frisky boy I set to explore the world on my own. When ridicule sprang, I was bewildered, and asked my parents why other children laughed and poked fun at me. Use the graphic organizer to find out the meaning of the words found in the selection.

Everyone   needs  change,  even  if  they  feel  like  they  don’t.Whatever aspect of life it is, still there’s still a need of change. Change cannot begone,   unless   you’re   perfect   in   everything.   There   is   still   a   lot   of   rooms   fordevelopment and improvement in one’s self and other beings, so by that change isconstant.4. How will you implement the seven C’s of lifelong skills in your life and career?- Having this seven C’s in our lives and careers means a lot for us. Thinking ofall the things in life, especially some problems or choices must need the CriticalThinking   and   Doing   lifelong   skill   in   all   times,   plus   Creativity   when   we   applysomething from imagination to reality to either help us or just present your ideas tothe world. And of course you really need to have Collaboration up and running. Youcannot do all things alone and by yourself, you really need to have someone to haveby your side. And as life goes on, you think that you knew everything but no. Youmust   have   an   open   mind   for   everything   that’s   all   about   the   world   and   yoursurroundings. You need to have some Cross-Cultural Understanding in your mindand in your heart. And going back in the Collaboration lifelong skill, you need to notbe alone by having Communication in everything and, as long as possible, everyoneso you won’t be as the world progresses, you need to have your body adapt to the digital world andhave the Computing lifelong skill, because it’s inevitable that the digital age shall runin the world for a long time. And last, you need to have the ability to grow in yourselfright? So implement the Career and Learning Self-Reliance lifelong skill to manageyourself and your life and career in the future.​</a>

Sa halip na maging takot o magpakita ng resistensya sa pagbabago, dapat maghanap ng paraan kung paano makakasunod sa pagbabago. Kailangan ding magpakita ng kakayahang mag-adjust at mag-adapt sa bagong sitwasyon o kalagayan. Mahalaga rin na maging bukas sa pagkakamali at pagkakaroon ng pagkukulang sa unang pagsubok sa pagbabago. Sa ganitong paraan, magagawa natin ang tamang pagbabago at makakamit natin ang mga layunin na nais nating maabot</p><br />

                            6. Earth: A Habitable PlanetRead the document carefully and answer the questions that follow Table 1. Factors that make a planet habitableFactors thatmake aPlanetHabitableNot Enough of the FactorJust RightToo Much of the FactorSituation in the Solar SystemTemperature influences how quickly atoms and molecules move.Low temperatures cause chemicals to react slowly, which interferes with the reactions necessary for life. It can also cause the freezing of water, making liquid water unavailable.Life seems to be limited to a temperature range of -15oC to 115oC. In this range, liquid water can still exist under certain conditions.At about 125oC, protein and carbohydrate molecules, and the genetic material (e.g., DNA and RNA) start to break apart. Also, high temperatures cause the quick evaporation of water.Surface: only the Earth’s surface is in this temperature range. Sub-surface: the interior of the solid planets and moons may be in this temperature range.AtmosphereSmall planets and moons have insufficient gravity to hold an atmosphere. The gas molecules escape to space, leaving the planet or moon without an insulating blanket or a protective shield.Earth and Venus are the right size to hold a sufficientatmosphere. Earth’s atmosphere is about 100 miles thick. It keeps the surface warm and protects it from radiation and small- to mediumsized meteorites.Venus’s atmosphere is 100 times thicker than Earth’s. It is made almost entirely of greenhouse gasses, making the surface too hot for life. The four giant planets are completely made of gas.Of the solid planets and moons, only Earth, Venus, and Titan have significant atmospheres. Mars’ atmosphere is about 1/100th that of Earth’s, too small for significant insulation or shielding.EnergyWhen there is too little sunlight or too few of the chemicals that provide energy to cells, such as iron or sulfur, organisms die.With a steady input of either light or chemical energy, cells can run the chemical reactions necessary for life.Light energy is a problem if it makes a planet too hot or if there are too many harmful rays, such as ultraviolet. Too many energy-rich chemicals is not a problemSurface: The inner planets get too much sunlight for life. The outer planets get too little. Sub-surface: Most solid planets and moons have energy-rich chemicals.Nutrients used to build and maintain an organism’s body.Without chemicals to make proteins and carbohydrates, organisms cannot grow. Planets without systems to deliver nutrients to its organisms (e.g., a water cycle or volcanic activity) cannot support life. Also, when nutrients are spread so thin that they are hard to obtain, such as on a gas planet, life cannot exist.All solid planets and moons have the same general chemical makeup, so nutrients are present. Those with a water cycle or volcanic activity can transport and replenish the chemicals required by living organisms.Too many nutrients are not a problem. However, too active a circulation system, such as the constant volcanism on Jupiter’s moon, Io, or the churning atmospheres of the gas planets, interferes with an organism’s ability to get enough nutrients.Surface: Earth has a water cycle, an atmosphere, and volcanoes to circulate nutrients. Venus, Titan, Io, and Mars have nutrients and ways to circulate them to organisms. Sub-surface: Any planet or moon with sub-surface water or molten rock can circulate and replenish nutrients for organismsFactors that make a planet habitable. National Science Question:1.

People require food to survive and this is a fundamental truth. Communication is essential in all relationships, whether it be personal or professional. Practice is necessary for skill development, and the more you practice a skill, the better you become at it. These postulates lead to theorems that explain these concepts in greater detail. For example, the more you practice a skill, the better you become at it, and this can be seen in various fields such as sports, music, and art. Similarly, good communication leads to better relationships and greater understanding, and this can be seen in how effective communication improves the quality of relationships. Lastly, if you don't eat regularly, your body will suffer from malnutrition and health problems, and this is something that can be seen in the real world when people don't have access to regular meals. These postulates and theorems illustrate fundamental truths that are applicable in our daily lives, and understanding them can help us navigate the world more effectively.</p><p></p><br />

                            10. What Is Education and Why Is It Important? By Ananya Mahapatra Source: https://www.atg.world/view-article/IMPORTANCEOFEDUCATION-70 Education is a learning experience where an individual learns about various aspects of life, understands the different perspectives and tries to apply it in daily life. Education is important to the children, to adults and to the society. Education gives people knowledge of the world around them and changes it into something better. It develops in people a perspective of looking at life, helps them build opinions and have points of view on things in life. Mahatma Gandhi once quoted, "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." This portrays the importance of education and leaming in one's life. If a child is joined in a school, he will start leaming, playing and enjoy with friends. While leaming he will understand what position he is in acquiring knowledge and he will leam slowly to grab the top position. While playing he will understand the logic to win it; this way they start building goals at an early stage. But parents should understand whether their children are working only for ranks and grades or acquiring some wisdom or not. It is important that they are aware of the purpose of education and how it works in real life. They start maintaining a structured life. To an individual, education increases the level of confidence as it makes a person aware about his/her surroundings. It also helps an individual to communicate better and express his/her opinions. The mind gets matured by proper education and training. A person can judge what is right and what is not. Education makes a person independent and helps him abide by the rules of the land. Education improves the standard of living of Written by: CLARIBEL C. BUENAVENTURA 3 the people. It helps people understand their needs and gives them the way to acquire them. Education provides a platform for a decent livelihood. One can take up a job in industry or another professional service if he/she is educated. Advances in medicine, war equipment, technology were possible due to constant exploration and research. People of current age carry this exploration. They could do so due to their education and knowledge about the past technology. People with higher education in science, mathematics, and technology can do this. The food production, medicine, electronic gadgets, automobiles and other luxury items were developed due to the spread of science and technology among the professionals through studies. To be a better human, an active participant in society and to gain respect from the world one should always learn new things. Leaming new things in education.

                            18. DISTURBACES IN ESTUARIES          Estuaries are partially enclosed coastal bodies of water where rivers meet the sea.They are homes to unique plants and animals that have adapted to brackish water-mixture fresh water draining from the land and salty seawater. Numerous marine species use the nutrient – rich and sheltered estuaries as nurserygrounds.          Some fish species not only migrate between the waters of the various oceans and seas, but also require migrating between freshwaters and the marine waters. Such fishes, which spend part of their life-cycle in salt-water and a part in freshwater, are called diadromous fishes, e.g. the eel fish, the salmon, and the trout. These include the anadromousspecies which migrate from the sea to freshwater for spawning (process oflaying eggs), and the catadromous species, which spawn in the ocean or at sea, and migrate towards freshwater as juveniles. The regions in many coastal areas are highly disturbed today due to constant disturbance from the mainland in the form of pollution—pesticidal pollution, discharge from sewage system, silt, and etc. Such disturbances in the estuarine and coastal areas make migration of diadromous fishes to their spawning areas difficult, and adversely affect their populations by acting as the major blockage in the lifecycle of these species.A.

Bowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilience are again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one is exempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently, Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy, but also on a lighter note, it came as a great global equalizer. This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and several universal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary. Our life, our wealth and all possessions we have, including our own skills and knowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even the most powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything is unpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation, we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go and our social connections and interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations and all things we hold dearly, with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftly becomes volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA world where all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change. And the very question is, 'Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on the government, family and friends for help? As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More than ever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faith to a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps us going and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and huge changes in this "new normal". We all are caught ofl-guard, but with our faith, we continue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive at all times. We learn how to look at the brighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, our faith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life's challenges. Therefore, let us hold onto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble nor fear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of viruses such as this COVID-19.​</h2><br />

                            25. Exercise 5. Read the excerpt and do the activities that follow. I am Juan Picas, born half of myself. I had only one eye, one ear, one arm, one leg, one half of a body. My mother wept when she saw me, but loved me as I grew up and never regarded me as abnormal. My father, too, must have wept although he never spoke of this. He also took me as I was and loved me as much as he knew how. I grew in their care; I thrived in their love. As far as I knew I was entire, I thought myself whole. Like all babies, I learned first to smile, and then to coo, to babble, and to know my mother and father, too. I learned to crawl, and sit up and, in time, to doodle. I learned to speak but even before that, I learned to laugh. My mother taught me how to laugh, perhaps even before I learned to cry. She showered me with good cheer, constant delight. She taught me how to sing. My father taught me how to see. The birds of the sky, the trees, the flowers that grew, the rains that fell and the winds that roared in the night – these my father spoke of and made me see how perfect they fitted into our world and made it as lovely as can be. My father also spoke of people, saying that they are on this earth and living this life as a test. All that matters is a life spent doing good. A man should apply his days in work and by his hands hone his heart in service to God and his fellowmen. Less than his intent and in labor done, a man’s days are but in vain. My father said this, and I realized how he directed his days and wished my life to be. My father often spoke of God as did my mother. The father in Heaven who made us and whose love will keep us alive. God orders our days from our birth, through our youth and manhood, through age and through death and after life. He has the whole world in His hands, rules the beatings of our hearts, knows the number of our hair, and loves us in everything whether good or ill befalls us. All of life’s road lead to him; and answers to life’s questions lie in Him. The meaning of life is with Him. My father and mother taught me this and I learned it. So I grew, a happy child swathed in kindness. My parents sheltered me and kept me away from prying eyes. I did not know harshness, cruelty, even less, until as a frisky boy I set to explore the world on my own. When ridicule sprang, I was bewildered, and asked my parents why other children laughed and poked fun at me. Use the graphic organizer to find out the meaning of the words found in the selection.
