And ask about my life as WHERE COULD IT BE OPPOSITE?. I hug myself and think of someone I hug, It's kinda painful to be alone. Everyone is sensitive and has a fears, My fair is being crowded in their Eye. Or getting suspicious in the crowd.I am not here for attention, I just wanna feel of how my life works, is it relatable from you?...

"That was great," Raul said without enthusiasm. Mike just looked down at his own skateboard.      "Of course it was great," replied Pete. "I'm the best skateboarder in this park."      "Uh, sure you are," said Raul. "After all, you were the first one to do a flip off the top of the ramp."      "Which you never let us forget," said Mike under his breath to Raul. Raul covered his smile with his hand.      "Hey, guys!" a new voice called out. The boys turned to see a girl skating over to them. "My name is Andrea. Do you mind if I join you?"      "Sorry, Andrea," Pete said. "This park is for real skateboarders only." Mike and Raul groaned at Pete's words.      "Well, if I prove that I'm a serious skater, can I stay?" Andrea asked.      "Yes!" replied Mike and Raul before Pete could speak. Andrea grabbed her skateboard and skated up the ramp. At the top of the ramp, she flipped her skateboard and landed in one smooth motion. Pete's mouth dropped open as she skated back.      "Where did you learn to do that?" Mike asked.      "My dad taught me. He grew up with a professional skateboarder," replied Andrea.      "No way!" all three boys cried.       "I don't believe you," Pete said angrily. "You just got lucky on that flip. Your dad doesn't really know a professional skateboarder."      "Then how did I get his signature on my skateboard?" Andrea asked. She picked up her skateboard and showed Mike and Raul.      "Can you show me how to do a flip?" Raul asked Andrea excitedly.      "I guess you aren't the best skater in the park after all," Mike said to Pete.  The dialogue in this story tells the reader that ___.</a>

The tame bird was in a cage; the free bird was in the forest,
They met when the time came; it was a decree of fate,
The free bird cried, "Oh my love let us fly to the worlds,"
The caged bird whispered, "Come here! Let us both live in the cage,"
Said the free birds, "Among bars, where is the room to spread one's

The free bird cried, "My darling, sing the song of the woodlands."
The cage bird said, "Sit by my side; I'll teach you the speech of the learned"
The free bird cried, "No oh no! Songs can never be taught!"
The cage bird said, "Alas for me!" I know not the songs of the woodlands!"
Their love was intense with longing, but they never could fly wing to
wing, through the bars, of the cage they looked and vain was their wish to
know each other, they fluttered their wings in yearning and sang. "Come
Closer My Love!"
The free bird cried, "It cannot be, I feel the closed doors of the cage!"
The caged bird whispered, "Alas, my wings are powerless and dead!"

If you collect all the four red stones, you will have the power of immortality” as soon as I read the line the cold chill ran through my bones because in my pocket, I have one red ruby were this is the last thing my mom gave me after she vanished into thin air but the fact that the red rubies is true, I finally got the courage to discover myself more.          As the excitement gives me shivers, I look up to Cecilia and were both smiling as we make eye contact, Cecilia knows that I love exploring when it comes to searching new things when Mystique Empire is involved. And I start to think of ideas to find and search the lost Mystique Empire.      Now I started with a new plan to find this red rubies and search first the map of the empire, I ask Cecilia to come with me and visit Cooper to ask more about this book’s content. As we arrive at Cooper’s house, I saw him at the balcony and waved at us, I and Cecilia wave back. “Good morning! Adam and Cecilia, what is it today? But before that come in”, he spoke using his angel like voice that can instantly put someone to sleep.“Is something bothering you?”, he asked me with a hint of excitement in his eyes.“Not that I was bothered, I found something interesting check this out”, I spoke truthfully and handed the book to him.“Does it have anything to do with how you want to find out about this rubies, well I’m in, so what’s the plan Adam?” Cooper said while smirking. Cecilia chuckled and said, “Don’t forget about me I ‘amalso part of this expedition”.Cooper also reveals that he made a trade with my uncle Jisei, the deal is that Cooper will give the treasure chest to uncle for a Journal, a book describing the history and path to Mystique Empire.          After the whole planning we are finally ready to take off to a spaceship that we barrowed to uncle Jisei who agree to use it in one condition that bring his spaceship in good shaped. The expedition is headed by me the one and only Adam Holmes. “We are now ready to take off in the count of five, four, three, two, one, launched on!” after the countdown, I launched on the spaceship.“We are now going to you, my beloved Mystique!” As Cecilia shouted with joy.While the spaceship is on pilot mode we talk about what route and step will do in the Mystique Empire if we find it. “The path says we should go straight to the bright red stars along our way, can you speed up this spaceship a bit faster Cooper, and Cecilia check both sides of the ship if there is an asteroid laser them.”“Roger that!” both Cooper and Cecilia said.         And then while they are on their task, I check my ruby and play it in my hand, I remember my mother giving me this as a symbol of being a true blooded mystique, I didn’t know at first that this will give me a power that I can obtain, but for now I need to find the place where I came from and what was really happened to the empire.​</a>

                                            My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in a
big family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.
One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a
nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do my
homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to
make them leave.
Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see
who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them
were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As
luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !
remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and
there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,
I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about
the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of
family
Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books
to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles
brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.
Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I
realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would
have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead
and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love
my family so much that I can't live without them.

I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well</a>

My own first personal memory of war was in 1968 As a 16-year-old dishwasher in a small diner in upstate New York, I watched a Vietnam veteran get off the bus, coming back from his first tour of duty in Vietnam, to be met by his family. And at a time in our history when heroes were hard to find, I thought I'd found one. I'd never seen anybody so handsome, so physical, so determined, so proud. Captain John Graham - Captain John Graham was his name. And he is a big part of the reason I went to West Point.2. "So I'd like you all to charge your glasses and join me in toasting the new Mr and Mrs Brown! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the bride and groom" "Wishing them all the health, wealth and happiness in the world, I'd like you all to join me in toasting the happy couple3. I always wanted to see what will be my life in the future, what will be my careerand wnat will l'become? As 1 reflected my childhood I have many dreams and aspirations that iwould like to accomplish within the next ten years to come. In ten years, I can see myself havingmany of my goals accomplished, if not accomplished, I will be working on accomplishing those goalsto fulfil my life. We all know when growing up that we all wanted that fairy tale ending with the house,car, kids, and the dog. Ten years from now I plan to be raising my children, coming out of collegewith several degrees, and being happy. They say in one's life we all make choices, but in the end,our choices make us. You're about to embark with me unto the long, curvy road of my life, and watchupon it as it unfolds through my eyes. This is my life as I see it will be ten years from now. I havemost of it planned out already. This is my story.4.

She was lovely. She was tall. She looked up to my brother with a smile, and her forehead was on a level with his mouth. "You are Baldo," she said and placed her hand ligh ly on my shoulder. Her nails were long, but they were not painted. She was fragrant like a morning when papayas are in bloom. And a smau aimpie appeared momenty nign on ner right cheek. "And this is Labing of whom I have heard so much." She held the wrist of one hand with the other and looked at Labang, and Laban; never stopped chewing his cud. He swallowed and brought up to his mouth more cud and the sound of his insides was like a drum. I laid a hand on labang's massive neck and said to her, "You may scratch his forehead now." She hesitated and I saw that her eyes were on the long, curving horns. But she came and touched Labang's forehead with her long fir gers, and Labang never stopped chewing his cud except that his big eyes are hal-closed. And by and by she was scratching his forehead very daintily. My brother Leon put down the two trunks on the grassy side of the road. He paid Ca Celin twice the usual tare from the station to the age of Nagrepcan. Inen he was standing beside us, and she turned to him eagerly. I watched Ca Celin, where he stood in front of his horse, and he ran his fingers through its forelock and could not keep his eyes away from her. "Maria---" brother Leon said. my He did not say Maring. He did not say Mayang. I knew then that he had always called her Maria and that to us all she would be Maria, and in my mind. I said 'Maria and it was a beautiful name. Directions: Get to know more of the character described in the story. Fill out the graphic organizer below. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.

                                            Love Your FamilyMy name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in abig family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be anice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do myhomework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed tomake them leave.Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to seewho's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of themwere out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. Asluck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here andthere. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked aboutthe homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind offamilyMother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me booksto keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and unclesbrought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then Irealized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what wouldhave happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the foreheadand said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I lovemy family so much that I can't live without them.Activity 1Directions: Answer the following questions based from the story read. Use your English activity notebook.Guide Questions:1.

I thought it would be a nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi 1 told them i will just stay home and do my homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to make them leave. Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One moment I was in terrible pain and the next thing I remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident, I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of family Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor. Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love my family so much that I can't live without them.

He gave me his head dress and told me to put it under my pillow. So I put it there to show my respect for him. It is Rupaksa who wants to kll you, not me.” But Raden no longer trust her. He decided to penalize Surati by giving her a death sentence near the riverbank. “Before I die, let me say a few words,” Surati pleaded. “Please do,” Raden granted Surati‘s request. Surati spoke calmly, “When I die, just throw my body into the river. If water becomes dirty and smelly, it means that I am guilty. But if the water becomes clear and fragrant, it means that I am innocent.” Then as Raden stabbed her wife with a kris, Surati threw herself into the river. Amazingly the water became clear and fragrant. Surati was innocent! Raden regretted what he had done. From then on, he changed the name of his kingdom into Banyuwangi. Banyu means water and Wangi means fragrance.guys  help  change  the ending story ​</a>

"That was great," Raul said without enthusiasm. Mike just looked down at his own skateboard.      "Of course it was great," replied Pete. "I'm the best skateboarder in this park."      "Uh, sure you are," said Raul. "After all, you were the first one to do a flip off the top of the ramp."      "Which you never let us forget," said Mike under his breath to Raul. Raul covered his smile with his hand.      "Hey, guys!" a new voice called out. The boys turned to see a girl skating over to them. "My name is Andrea. Do you mind if I join you?"      "Sorry, Andrea," Pete said. "This park is for real skateboarders only." Mike and Raul groaned at Pete's words.      "Well, if I prove that I'm a serious skater, can I stay?" Andrea asked.      "Yes!" replied Mike and Raul before Pete could speak. Andrea grabbed her skateboard and skated up the ramp. At the top of the ramp, she flipped her skateboard and landed in one smooth motion. Pete's mouth dropped open as she skated back.      "Where did you learn to do that?" Mike asked.      "My dad taught me. He grew up with a professional skateboarder," replied Andrea.      "No way!" all three boys cried.       "I don't believe you," Pete said angrily. "You just got lucky on that flip. Your dad doesn't really know a professional skateboarder."      "Then how did I get his signature on my skateboard?" Andrea asked. She picked up her skateboard and showed Mike and Raul.      "Can you show me how to do a flip?" Raul asked Andrea excitedly.      "I guess you aren't the best skater in the park after all," Mike said to Pete.  The dialogue in this story tells the reader that ___.</h2><br />

The tame bird was in a cage; the free bird was in the forest,
They met when the time came; it was a decree of fate,
The free bird cried, "Oh my love let us fly to the worlds,"
The caged bird whispered, "Come here! Let us both live in the cage,"
Said the free birds, "Among bars, where is the room to spread one's
"Alas", said the cage bird, "I should not know where to sit, perched in

The free bird cried, "My darling, sing the song of the woodlands."
The cage bird said, "Sit by my side; I'll teach you the speech of the learned"
The free bird cried, "No oh no! Songs can never be taught!"
The cage bird said, "Alas for me!" I know not the songs of the woodlands!"
Their love was intense with longing, but they never could fly wing to
wing, through the bars, of the cage they looked and vain was their wish to
know each other, they fluttered their wings in yearning and sang. "Come
Closer My Love!"
The free bird cried, "It cannot be, I feel the closed doors of the cage!"
The caged bird whispered, "Alas, my wings are powerless and dead!"

The poor mother Bennett leaves her son Adam behind, because the ground is where Bennett stepping on is lifted onto the sky with the red light and vanished into thin air. Pave the way unto a new beginning        a beginning where the son of Bennett’s discoveries started finding his hometown; a beginning of a story where Adam and his friends will experience a journey with conflict and adventure.          The sun was shining very lightly, and the birds chirped along with the alarm clock. And I ‘am done preparing my bag ang books that I borrowed from my Uncle Jisei. While walking down the stoned road I hear my friend Cecilia repeatedly calling my name, “Hey Adam! I’m here” and run towards me and show me a book that says, ‘Red Rubies of Mystique Empire’ I at her with a confused face then she replied, “I found this book at your uncle’s bookshelf do you think it is something sentimental?” then I immediately took the book on her and read it. I open the pages of the book and there is a word that caught my attention, the word is, “The charisma of red rubies gives power to the people living in the city of Mystique, but there are only four humans have this. If you collect all the four red stones, you will have the power of immortality” as soon as I read the line the cold chill ran through my bones because in my pocket, I have one red ruby were this is the last thing my mom gave me after she vanished into thin air but the fact that the red rubies is true, I finally got the courage to discover myself more.          As the excitement gives me shivers, I look up to Cecilia and were both smiling as we make eye contact, Cecilia knows that I love exploring when it comes to searching new things when Mystique Empire is involved. And I start to think of ideas to find and search the lost Mystique Empire.      Now I started with a new plan to find this red rubies and search first the map of the empire, I ask Cecilia to come with me and visit Cooper to ask more about this book’s content. As we arrive at Cooper’s house, I saw him at the balcony and waved at us, I and Cecilia wave back. “Good morning! Adam and Cecilia, what is it today? But before that come in”, he spoke using his angel like voice that can instantly put someone to sleep.“Is something bothering you?”, he asked me with a hint of excitement in his eyes.“Not that I was bothered, I found something interesting check this out”, I spoke truthfully and handed the book to him.“Does it have anything to do with how you want to find out about this rubies, well I’m in, so what’s the plan Adam?” Cooper said while smirking. Cecilia chuckled and said, “Don’t forget about me I ‘amalso part of this expedition”.Cooper also reveals that he made a trade with my uncle Jisei, the deal is that Cooper will give the treasure chest to uncle for a Journal, a book describing the history and path to Mystique Empire.          After the whole planning we are finally ready to take off to a spaceship that we barrowed to uncle Jisei who agree to use it in one condition that bring his spaceship in good shaped. The expedition is headed by me the one and only Adam Holmes. “We are now ready to take off in the count of five, four, three, two, one, launched on!” after the countdown, I launched on the spaceship.“We are now going to you, my beloved Mystique!” As Cecilia shouted with joy.While the spaceship is on pilot mode we talk about what route and step will do in the Mystique Empire if we find it. “The path says we should go straight to the bright red stars along our way, can you speed up this spaceship a bit faster Cooper, and Cecilia check both sides of the ship if there is an asteroid laser them.”“Roger that!” both Cooper and Cecilia said.         And then while they are on their task, I check my ruby and play it in my hand, I remember my mother giving me this as a symbol of being a true blooded mystique, I didn’t know at first that this will give me a power that I can obtain, but for now I need to find the place where I came from and what was really happened to the empire.​</h2><br />

                            13. My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in a
big family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me.
One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a
nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi. I told them I will just stay home and do my
homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to
make them leave.
Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see
who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them
were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As
luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !
remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and
there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,
I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about
the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of
family
Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books
to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles
brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.
Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I
realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would
have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead
and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love
my family so much that I can't live without them.

                            14. What is the mood in the song called "All Too Well by Taylor Swift" ?
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well</h2><br />

She was tall. She looked up to my brother with a smile, and her forehead was on a level with his mouth. "You are Baldo," she said and placed her hand ligh ly on my shoulder. Her nails were long, but they were not painted. She was fragrant like a morning when papayas are in bloom. And a smau aimpie appeared momenty nign on ner right cheek. "And this is Labing of whom I have heard so much." She held the wrist of one hand with the other and looked at Labang, and Laban; never stopped chewing his cud. He swallowed and brought up to his mouth more cud and the sound of his insides was like a drum. I laid a hand on labang's massive neck and said to her, "You may scratch his forehead now." She hesitated and I saw that her eyes were on the long, curving horns. But she came and touched Labang's forehead with her long fir gers, and Labang never stopped chewing his cud except that his big eyes are hal-closed. And by and by she was scratching his forehead very daintily. My brother Leon put down the two trunks on the grassy side of the road. He paid Ca Celin twice the usual tare from the station to the age of Nagrepcan. Inen he was standing beside us, and she turned to him eagerly. I watched Ca Celin, where he stood in front of his horse, and he ran his fingers through its forelock and could not keep his eyes away from her. "Maria---" brother Leon said. my He did not say Maring. He did not say Mayang. I knew then that he had always called her Maria and that to us all she would be Maria, and in my mind. I said 'Maria and it was a beautiful name. Directions: Get to know more of the character described in the story. Fill out the graphic organizer below. Use a separate sheet of paper for your answers.

My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed tomake them leave.Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to seewho's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of themwere out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. Asluck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One mornent I was in terrible pain and the next thing !remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here andthere. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident,I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked aboutthe homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind offamilyMother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me booksto keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and unclesbrought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor.Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then Irealized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what wouldhave happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the foreheadand said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I lovemy family so much that I can't live without them.Activity 1Directions: Answer the following questions based from the story read. Use your English activity notebook.Guide Questions:1.

Tell me who he is.” Surati was defenseless, she cried. “It is my brother‘s head dress. I met him several days ago when you went hunting. He gave me his head dress and told me to put it under my pillow. So I put it there to show my respect for him. It is Rupaksa who wants to kll you, not me.” But Raden no longer trust her. He decided to penalize Surati by giving her a death sentence near the riverbank. “Before I die, let me say a few words,” Surati pleaded. “Please do,” Raden granted Surati‘s request. Surati spoke calmly, “When I die, just throw my body into the river. If water becomes dirty and smelly, it means that I am guilty. But if the water becomes clear and fragrant, it means that I am innocent.” Then as Raden stabbed her wife with a kris, Surati threw herself into the river. Amazingly the water became clear and fragrant. Surati was innocent! Raden regretted what he had done. From then on, he changed the name of his kingdom into Banyuwangi. Banyu means water and Wangi means fragrance.guys  help  change  the ending story ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Raden realized that he had been wrong to accuse Surati and punished her without giving her a chance to defend herself. He was filled with regret and remorse for his actions. Raden decided to do everything he could to make amends for his mistake. He searched for Surati's brother, Rupaksa, and brought him to justice for trying to harm Raden. Raden also made sure that Surati's memory was honored and celebrated in his kingdom. He renamed the kingdom Banyuwangi in her honor, and made sure that the people of the kingdom knew the story of Surati's innocence and Raden's regret. Raden also vowed to always be fair and just in his rule, and to never again make a decision without considering all the facts and evidence.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
