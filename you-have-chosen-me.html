                                            How do you see Jesus now? Who is Jesus Christ to you?
Based on what you have read in gospels, draw a symbol to illustrate what you have learned. Make a short explanation about the symbol you have chosen and its relationship to the person of Jesus. (15 points)
(ex. Candle, Jesus is my light, He gives me the light – His life so I can see and live.
 Just like the candle that consumes itself to give light/life to others.)</a>

She was an orphan and had no family to look after her. Despite this, she was determined to make something of her life and worked hard every day.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>One day, Sarah heard about a magical forest that was said to be full of wonders and treasures. She decided to take the risk and venture into the forest in search of adventure. As she ventured deeper into the forest, she encountered many strange creatures and obstacles that tested her courage and strength. </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Sarah eventually came across a mysterious cave that seemed to be calling out to her. She entered the cave cautiously, but soon found herself surrounded by beautiful crystals that glowed with an otherworldly light. In the center of the cave was an ancient stone tablet with strange symbols inscribed on it. </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Sarah realized that this tablet held the key to unlocking great power, but it would require great courage and strength to do so. She took a deep breath and stepped forward, determined to unlock its secrets no matter what it took. </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>With each step forward, Sarah felt her courage grow stronger until finally she reached out and touched the tablet with both hands. Suddenly, a bright light filled the cave as Sarah felt an incredible power surge through her body. </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>When she opened her eyes again, Sarah found herself standing in front of a magnificent castle surrounded by lush green fields and forests full of life.

With newfound courage and strength, Sarah set out on an epic journey to save this kingdom from evil forces that threatened its existence. </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The moral of this story is that no matter how small or powerless you may feel at times, you can always find strength within yourself if you are brave enough to take risks and face your fears head-on!</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> PA BRAINLIEST </p><p></p><br />

Without these rules, consumers would struggle to grasp the sort of message that the designer is attempting to deliver. An successful layout not only appears appealing, but also assists the observer in understanding the content conveyed by the design. In other words, knowing layout is critical when it comes to producing user-friendly, engaging designs, especially in online design and advertising. Effective infographics have a few key characteristics. They're well-designed, tell a compelling story, and are simple to grasp. They provide a visual element of material in a simple and snackable format.<p>[tex]\huge\blue {\overline{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \: \: }}\small\blue {\overline{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \\}}[/tex]</p><p>[tex]\large \color{red} \bold{@LukeCha15}[/tex]</p><br />
