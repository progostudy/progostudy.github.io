FATHER’S DAY MESSAGE
First of all, I would like to address that not every father is perfect. Every human makes a mistake at least once in his or her life. And these include both of our parents, especially our fathers.
Our fathers are considered as the head of the family, and for understandable reasons, they are responsible for taking care for the family as a whole. While a mother may be the light, the father will be the leader.
But we take the role of our fathers for granted, with modern times rushing in, the role of fathers seem to be less prominent than it ever was before.  With single mothers increasing every day and most fathers disappearing.
But for the fathers that stuck around, I would like to thank yous. Thank you for facing your problems, thank you for staying with us even though you knew for a fact that being a father come with great responsibility.
More specifically, I would like to thank my dad for staying with us for this long. Dealing with our problems and incompetency with such patience, and even though there were some moments where things go wrong, you still stood d up by our side.
And for the fathers that didn’t
I honestly can’t blame you</p>

1. “There is no love greater than a parents love.” My parents are amazing parents. Without them I would not be the strong and healthy young men I am today. My parents deserve to be happy, in order for that to happen, they want to see me succeed in life, be happy, and live life to the fullest. I owe my parents a lot, because they are the ones who welcome me in this world. And without them I wouldn’t gain the knowledge that I have today. So in return, when I succeed in life, I would make them the happiest parents in the world. I thank them for never giving up on me, although sometimes I am very stubborn.
2. The relationship between the parents and their children is special. Though parents may seem to be harsh, just because they want the best for them. They want their children to grow up disciplined and strong. Parents are the first people who deserve your attention. Through all the years they put efforts to protect you from troubles. We all know our parents will always by our side when we get in trouble or lose everything. They are the ones who pay for your college tuition, your food, and a place to stay. They will help as much as they can.</a>

                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="summarize1-%e2%80%9cthere-is-no-love-greater-than-a-parents-love-%e2%80%9d-my-parents-are-amazing-parents-without-them-i-would-not-be-the-strong-and-healthy-young-men-i-am-today-my-parents-deserve">
                            5. Summarize
1. “There is no love greater than a parents love.” My parents are amazing parents. Without them I would not be the strong and healthy young men I am today. My parents deserve to be happy, in order for that to happen, they want to see me succeed in life, be happy, and live life to the fullest. I owe my parents a lot, because they are the ones who welcome me in this world. And without them I wouldn’t gain the knowledge that I have today. So in return, when I succeed in life, I would make them the happiest parents in the world. I thank them for never giving up on me, although sometimes I am very stubborn.
2. The relationship between the parents and their children is special. Though parents may seem to be harsh, just because they want the best for them. They want their children to grow up disciplined and strong. Parents are the first people who deserve your attention. Through all the years they put efforts to protect you from troubles. We all know our parents will always by our side when we get in trouble or lose everything. They are the ones who pay for your college tuition, your food, and a place to stay. They will help as much as they can.</h2><br />
