He said, “Go to the market and buy something that is large enough to fill my bedroom, but small enough to fit in your pocket. From this, I will decide which of you is the wisest and worthy enough to inherit my land.” They all went to the market, and each came back with a different item. The father told his sons to come into his bedroom one at a time and try to fill up his bedroom with their item. The first son came in and put some pieces of cloth he bought and laid them across the room, but it barely covered the floor. The second son came in and laid some hay on the floor, but there was only enough to cover half the floor. The third son came in and showed his father what he bought. He wound up getting the property. What did the third son show his father?</a>

A week ago, something happened in our training camp. The night after we moved up to Baguio City, some rebels attacked our camp. It was so unexpected that we didn't know what to do. Since we only brought with us blank bullets, we were not able to fight back. We were lucky that our reinforcement came, and they drove the rebels away. I still tremble when I think of that terrible encounter. I think a soldier's life is harsh and rough, however, I still vow to protect our people and country from the hostilities of the rebels. In time, I will be a real good soldier. What is the arrangement of these events from the text? Write it in a short paragraph with your conclusion. a. The reinforcement came and drove the rebels away. b. They realized that a soldier's life is harsh and rough. c. Some rebels attacked the camp. d. They moved up to Baguio City.​</a>

A salesclerk came up to me and dad came running toward me and ask if I was okay. She got on the public address system and notified the customers that a little boy with blue jeans and a red cap was lost. Two minutes later my mom and dad came running toward me.

He said, “Go to the market and buy something that is large enough to fill my bedroom, but small enough to fit in your pocket. From this, I will decide which of you is the wisest and worthy enough to inherit my land.” They all went to the market, and each came back with a different item. The father told his sons to come into his bedroom one at a time and try to fill up his bedroom with their item. The first son came in and put some pieces of cloth he bought and laid them across the room, but it barely covered the floor. The second son came in and laid some hay on the floor, but there was only enough to cover half the floor. The third son came in and showed his father what he bought. He wound up getting the property. What did the third son show his father?

Then answer the questions.There was once a wonderful musician, and he was one day walking through a wood all alone, he said to himself, "I will bring out a good companion."So he fiddled so that the wood echoed. A wolf came up to him. "Oh, a wolf!" Said the musician, "Ho, how finely you play! I must learn how to play too." "That is easily done," answered the musician, "you have only to do exactly as I tell you." "I will obey you," said the wolf. They came to an old oak tree, which was cleft through the middle. "Look here," said the musician, "if you want to learn how to fiddle, you must put your feet in this cleft." The wolf obeyed, but he took up a stone and wedged both his paws that the wolf was a prisoner. After a while he said to himself, I will bring out another companion," and fiddled away in the wood. This time a fox came "Oh, fox!" said the musician; the fox said, "O musician, how finely you play! I must learn how to play too." "That is easily done," said the musician, "you have only to do exactly as I tell you." "O musician," answered the fox, "I will obey you." So as they came to a footpath with a high hedge on each side and taking hold of a hazel-branch bent it down to the earth, and said: "Little fox, if you wish to learn something, reach your left foot."The fox obeyed. When the knots were fast enough he let go and the fox, shaking and struggling, in the air. The wolf meanwhile had struggled, and got himself out of the cleft. Full of anger he hastened after the musician to tear him to pieces. The fox cried out, "Brother Wolf, help me! The musician has betrayed me." The musician had again played his fiddle and a woodcutter with his axe under his arm, came to listen to the music. "It was a man I wanted, and not wild animals." And then he began to play so sweetly that the poor man's heart was filled with joy. And there came the wolf and the fox. Then the woodcutter raised his shining axe, and stood in front of the musician. Then the animals ran back into the wood, and the musician, played once more to the man to show his gratitude.Answer each question.1. What did the musician say to himself?2. Who did come first and what did the musician do with him?3. When did the musician fiddle who came out next?4. What did musician do with the fox?5. How did the wolf and the fox get themselves out?6. Who came last when the musician fiddled?​</a>

                            20. A father told his three sons he would die soon and he needed to decide which one of them to give his property to. He said, “Go to the market and buy something that is large enough to fill my bedroom, but small enough to fit in your pocket. From this, I will decide which of you is the wisest and worthy enough to inherit my land.” They all went to the market, and each came back with a different item. The father told his sons to come into his bedroom one at a time and try to fill up his bedroom with their item. The first son came in and put some pieces of cloth he bought and laid them across the room, but it barely covered the floor. The second son came in and laid some hay on the floor, but there was only enough to cover half the floor. The third son came in and showed his father what he bought. He wound up getting the property.

After considering a lot of factors, he came down with two choices; buy stocks or construct a building to be rented out to others as a dormitory. Which option would work best for Eison and why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:  Construct a building to be rented out to others as a dormitory</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:  Since Eison is </strong><strong>nearing</strong><strong> his retirement, he needs to invest in something that is more predictable.  The stock market may be a good investment option if Eison has a lot of time before his retirement. The challenge with the stock market is that it is volatile (it moves around up or down a lot) over a short period of time.  On the other hand, renting out a dormitory where Eison knows there is good demand may be a safer bet.  This way he will be able to earn monthly rental income to pay for his expenses during retirement.   </strong></p><p></p><br />

Then answer the questions.There was once a wonderful musician, and he was one day walking through a wood all alone, he said to himself, "I will bring out a good companion."So he fiddled so that the wood echoed. A wolf came up to him. "Oh, a wolf!" Said the musician, "Ho, how finely you play! I must learn how to play too." "That is easily done," answered the musician, "you have only to do exactly as I tell you." "I will obey you," said the wolf. They came to an old oak tree, which was cleft through the middle. "Look here," said the musician, "if you want to learn how to fiddle, you must put your feet in this cleft." The wolf obeyed, but he took up a stone and wedged both his paws that the wolf was a prisoner. After a while he said to himself, I will bring out another companion," and fiddled away in the wood. This time a fox came "Oh, fox!" said the musician; the fox said, "O musician, how finely you play! I must learn how to play too." "That is easily done," said the musician, "you have only to do exactly as I tell you." "O musician," answered the fox, "I will obey you." So as they came to a footpath with a high hedge on each side and taking hold of a hazel-branch bent it down to the earth, and said: "Little fox, if you wish to learn something, reach your left foot."The fox obeyed. When the knots were fast enough he let go and the fox, shaking and struggling, in the air. The wolf meanwhile had struggled, and got himself out of the cleft. Full of anger he hastened after the musician to tear him to pieces. The fox cried out, "Brother Wolf, help me! The musician has betrayed me." The musician had again played his fiddle and a woodcutter with his axe under his arm, came to listen to the music. "It was a man I wanted, and not wild animals." And then he began to play so sweetly that the poor man's heart was filled with joy. And there came the wolf and the fox. Then the woodcutter raised his shining axe, and stood in front of the musician. Then the animals ran back into the wood, and the musician, played once more to the man to show his gratitude.Answer each question.1. What did the musician say to himself?2.
