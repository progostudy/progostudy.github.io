                                            Plato, Aristotle, and Augustine have included in their philosophies the concept of eudaimonia or human flourishing, or in layman's terms, happiness. They were right about saying that it is happiness that the self is searching for, no matter how mundane, no matter how absurd.
Consider this an activity of gratitude for things that give us joy -- great or small.
So, write down all the things that make you profoundly happy.</a>

                                            MINI TASK
Little things always make a difference. Rational numbers (FRACTIONS) are
considered to have the least value in the family of numbers but no matter how small
their values are, fractions are still considered as a very important component in the
world of mathematics and in our daily activities. Your task is, you are going toko 3
pictures of small things in your house that shows fraction. You are going to explain why
you chose those things and how it is related to fractions. You will also answer a guided
question.
Process Questions:
1. What fraction is present in the picture?
2. Base on the pictures, what is the sum of all the fractions?
3. What is the difference of the first and last fraction?</a>

considered to have the least value in the family of numbers but no matter how small
their values are, fractions are still considered as a very important component in the
world of mathematics and in our daily activities. Your task is, you are going toko 3
pictures of small things in your house that shows fraction. You are going to explain why
you chose those things and how it is related to fractions. You will also answer a guided
question.
Process Questions:
1. What fraction is present in the picture?
2. Base on the pictures, what is the sum of all the fractions?
3. What is the difference of the first and last fraction?</h2><br />
