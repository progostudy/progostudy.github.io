I enjoyed each beautiful day atid it's a blessing. My eyes were open before the rays of the sun shone. I folded my favorite blanket inade of flour sack and took a long deep breath to begin the day. As I slowly tiptoed down the bamboo ladder, I saw my nanay staring in the air. Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me. Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort. Then, I told her, "Don't worry nay. I will help you in any way I can. I won't stop studying." Saying that promise, I went out of our dilapidated house with determination to surpass this financially drain situation. As I walked along the street, I could smell the fresh, buttery bread which makes my empty stomach grumble in hunger. I respectfully approached the bakery owner standing just outside the bakeshop as she managed the workers. “Ma'am, may I sell your pandesal in our barangay? You may give me commission based on the sold bread. I need to help my nanay since she doesn't have work." The owner stared at me with a stern look from head to toe. Then she said in a bossy tone, "All right. Be honest!" I happily carried the heavy blue ice bucket with 50 pieces of pandesal in it. The heaviness did not bother me for I counted the commission to receive once sold. I shouted loudly, "PANDESALI PANDESAL! PANDESAL!" It was eight o'clock in the morning when my pandesal was sold. I decided to sit under the shade of the big mango tree. I carefully counted the money if it was in right amount to remit to the owner. While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When, suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream. 1. Describe the setting of the story. 2. Describe the girl's character. 3. What would you do if you were on the girl's shoe and your money was taken away? Explain your answer. 4. In your own ways, how can you help your parents / guardians? 5. Give a title of the story.​</a>

                                            Piolo Pascual: The frugal, private person behind the bankable movie star. Everybody knows Piolo Pascual. In a nutshell, the story tells the bittersweet tale of a 19-year old overseas Filipino who had to work double shifts and 16-hour duties as a hospital worker by day and a security guard at night just to make ends meet. At present, he is the endorser of BDO Remit. In one of its webinars, Piolo talks about the importance of saving and how a movie star like him has been managing his finances during the quarantine period. "Saving has been an important practice in our family. When I was in school and began working, it was the practical thing to do. You save up for things you want to buy. If you have money saved, you will have something to bank on when unexpected situations happen, such as this pandemic. I knew I had to set aside something for a rainy day and save money that I can use when I do not have anything else. So, ever since I started working, puro savings na talaga ako, I made sure I was not sure spending beyond what I could afford. I never changed my lifestyle. I have always lived a simple life," Piolo said. "I invested in farming because it is a nice feeling to grow your own crops or eat your own produce. Nag-invest ako sa mga bagay na pwede mong paikutin. I now have 18 chickens na galling sa farm ko para yun na lang ang kakainin naming. Mas nakakatipid ka pa. We were going to sell them during the lockdown dahil ang dami na ngang manok. So, they were not just for us. We also share them with friends," Piolo added. Questions to ponder: Analyze Piolo's testimony on his saving and spending experience? How it has influenced your view on managing finances? Use another sheet of paper for your answer.​</a>

story along now in honor of the woman who shared it. You see these beautiful 
white sneakers? I didn’t always have them. My last pair of shoes was pretty 
sad. I was holding them together with cardboard and masking tape. So I 
decided to go to the mall to get a new pair. There’s a shoes store that often
has sneakers I can afford. Walking through the mall I knew everyone was 
looking at me being there. I wanted to get my new shoes quick and leave. 
Walking down the aisle, I saw a really nice pair of white sneakers. There was 
3
only this one pair in my size left. I put them on and couldn’t believe how good 
they felt. I walk all around the store in them, thinking how nice it would be if 
they were mine. I knew I didn’t have money to get them that day but I also 
knew if I waited they ‘d be gone. I brought them up to the front of the store 
and asked the guy behind the counter if he would hold them for me. He said 
it was against store policy. I promised him I would come back as soon as I 
could to buy them but he just kept shaking his head and saying no, he 
couldn’t. I put my masking tape sneakers back on and left the mall as fast as 
I could.
For weeks I had to work hard to earn enough money for the sneakers. 
When I had the money already, I ran to the store and went directly to the shelf 
where I left it, but it was not there anymore. Sadly, I started walking out of 
the door but suddenly the store cashier yelled, “I have your shoes!” Hearing 
what he said, I turned back, “I got the money now to pay for them.” “No, no, 
they’re already paid for you,” he said. I wondered who paid for it, but excitedly 
I wear my new white sneakers with the money still in my pocket and left my 
old shoes in the trash bin. I used to think no one was on my side. But on the
day I knew that any person I walked by could be the one who gave my new 
shoes. Whoever they were, I wanted them to know I was saying, “Thank you”.

                                            Twin Sisters Noodle House: Don’t Ever Leave Me The lady manager of a bank's branch in Malolos City was amused to hear her high school classmate, Marylou Andres, declare: "In my noodle house business, I never use paper to communicate with my subordinates. As soon as hire anyone, I give him or her verbal instructions on what I expect them to do. Once a week, I call everyone to a meeting and I relay to them my general Instructions for the week." Marylou and her twin sister, MaryAnn, jointly own and manage TWIN SISTERSNOODLE HOUSE. Their main shop is located at Malolos with a complement of nineEmployees composed of a supervisor, a cook, an assistant cook, a cashier, two waiters,A driver, a security guard, and a janitor. At the beginning, there were only three of them,The twins and a helper. They did all they can to make the venture a viable concern.Between the three of them, they performed the various functions related to cooking,Purchasing, promoting, maintaining cleanliness, and the like. As customers slowlyPoured in, they gradually hired people until there were nine of them. Five years after their successful Malolos operations, the twins opened a branchAt a junction in Plaridel. MaryAnn took charge of managing the branch. Within a fewMonths, the branch showed potentials greater than the Malolos main. The twins were experiencing the joys of a successful venture when Marylou suddenly took a leave to undergo surgery to remove gallstones in her system. The situation forced MaryAnn to simultaneously manage the two outlets. After a while, the cook in Malolos began to experience discomfort in MaryAnn'sManagement style. He complained about the restrictive policies of MaryAnn. He wasScolded several times for doing what he normally did when Marylou was supervised. For instance, MaryAnn questioned the quality of seasoning he applies on the food he cooks. He was also scolded for using kitchen utensils on instances Marylou Thought as inappropriate. The cook started to harbor ill feelings toward MaryAnn. He thought he can noLonger work effectively under such conditions. When a job opening for another restaurant was relayed to him by a friend, he applied. When he was informed that he will be hired, he resigned from Twin Sisters Noodle House. Guide Questions:     Is there anything wrong with the set-up of the firm?     If you were MaryAnn, what will you do?​</a>

                            5. Read the given story. Then answer the questions that follow In this dream I was the girl with tattered short pants and shirt. I enjoyed each beautiful day atid it's a blessing. My eyes were open before the rays of the sun shone. I folded my favorite blanket inade of flour sack and took a long deep breath to begin the day. As I slowly tiptoed down the bamboo ladder, I saw my nanay staring in the air. Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me. Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort. Then, I told her, "Don't worry nay. I will help you in any way I can. I won't stop studying." Saying that promise, I went out of our dilapidated house with determination to surpass this financially drain situation. As I walked along the street, I could smell the fresh, buttery bread which makes my empty stomach grumble in hunger. I respectfully approached the bakery owner standing just outside the bakeshop as she managed the workers. “Ma'am, may I sell your pandesal in our barangay? You may give me commission based on the sold bread. I need to help my nanay since she doesn't have work." The owner stared at me with a stern look from head to toe. Then she said in a bossy tone, "All right. Be honest!" I happily carried the heavy blue ice bucket with 50 pieces of pandesal in it. The heaviness did not bother me for I counted the commission to receive once sold. I shouted loudly, "PANDESALI PANDESAL! PANDESAL!" It was eight o'clock in the morning when my pandesal was sold. I decided to sit under the shade of the big mango tree. I carefully counted the money if it was in right amount to remit to the owner. While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When, suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream. 1.

                            8. Piolo Pascual: The frugal, private person behind the bankable movie star. Everybody knows Piolo Pascual. In a nutshell, the story tells the bittersweet tale of a 19-year old overseas Filipino who had to work double shifts and 16-hour duties as a hospital worker by day and a security guard at night just to make ends meet. At present, he is the endorser of BDO Remit. In one of its webinars, Piolo talks about the importance of saving and how a movie star like him has been managing his finances during the quarantine period. "Saving has been an important practice in our family. When I was in school and began working, it was the practical thing to do. You save up for things you want to buy. If you have money saved, you will have something to bank on when unexpected situations happen, such as this pandemic. I knew I had to set aside something for a rainy day and save money that I can use when I do not have anything else. So, ever since I started working, puro savings na talaga ako, I made sure I was not sure spending beyond what I could afford. I never changed my lifestyle. I have always lived a simple life," Piolo said. "I invested in farming because it is a nice feeling to grow your own crops or eat your own produce. Nag-invest ako sa mga bagay na pwede mong paikutin. I now have 18 chickens na galling sa farm ko para yun na lang ang kakainin naming. Mas nakakatipid ka pa. We were going to sell them during the lockdown dahil ang dami na ngang manok. So, they were not just for us. We also share them with friends," Piolo added. Questions to ponder: Analyze Piolo's testimony on his saving and spending experience? How it has influenced your view on managing finances? Use another sheet of paper for your answer.​</h2><br />

                            10. story:Tell Me a Story About Your Shoes
By: Lani Peterson ©2014
https://healingstory.org/tell-me-a-story-about-your-shoes/
One Thursday morning at a soup kitchen /community center for 
homeless women in downtown Cagayan de Oro, I was given this gift of a story 
in response to the opening prompt, Tell me about your shoes.” I pass this 
story along now in honor of the woman who shared it. You see these beautiful 
white sneakers? I didn’t always have them. My last pair of shoes was pretty 
sad. I was holding them together with cardboard and masking tape. So I 
decided to go to the mall to get a new pair. There’s a shoes store that often
has sneakers I can afford. Walking through the mall I knew everyone was 
looking at me being there. I wanted to get my new shoes quick and leave. 
Walking down the aisle, I saw a really nice pair of white sneakers. There was 
3
only this one pair in my size left. I put them on and couldn’t believe how good 
they felt. I walk all around the store in them, thinking how nice it would be if 
they were mine. I knew I didn’t have money to get them that day but I also 
knew if I waited they ‘d be gone. I brought them up to the front of the store 
and asked the guy behind the counter if he would hold them for me. He said 
it was against store policy. I promised him I would come back as soon as I 
could to buy them but he just kept shaking his head and saying no, he 
couldn’t. I put my masking tape sneakers back on and left the mall as fast as 
I could.
For weeks I had to work hard to earn enough money for the sneakers. 
When I had the money already, I ran to the store and went directly to the shelf 
where I left it, but it was not there anymore. Sadly, I started walking out of 
the door but suddenly the store cashier yelled, “I have your shoes!” Hearing 
what he said, I turned back, “I got the money now to pay for them.” “No, no, 
they’re already paid for you,” he said. I wondered who paid for it, but excitedly 
I wear my new white sneakers with the money still in my pocket and left my 
old shoes in the trash bin. I used to think no one was on my side. But on the
day I knew that any person I walked by could be the one who gave my new 
shoes. Whoever they were, I wanted them to know I was saying, “Thank you”.

I feel unsafe but I can do nothing but to adapt to the new home where we now belong. At night time, I hear loud voices shouting outside until later I am used to it. Months later, as I roam around our school, I saw some children vandalizing and doing unnecessary things. I felt like quitting and going back to our old home away from the city. But I can't go back home since my father has already his new family in our old community As days pass by, I just ignore those scenes and things that I see in my new school and community even though they give me impacts of fear and unsafety.

                            29. Twin Sisters Noodle House: Don’t Ever Leave Me The lady manager of a bank's branch in Malolos City was amused to hear her high school classmate, Marylou Andres, declare: "In my noodle house business, I never use paper to communicate with my subordinates. As soon as hire anyone, I give him or her verbal instructions on what I expect them to do. Once a week, I call everyone to a meeting and I relay to them my general Instructions for the week." Marylou and her twin sister, MaryAnn, jointly own and manage TWIN SISTERSNOODLE HOUSE. Their main shop is located at Malolos with a complement of nineEmployees composed of a supervisor, a cook, an assistant cook, a cashier, two waiters,A driver, a security guard, and a janitor. At the beginning, there were only three of them,The twins and a helper. They did all they can to make the venture a viable concern.Between the three of them, they performed the various functions related to cooking,Purchasing, promoting, maintaining cleanliness, and the like. As customers slowlyPoured in, they gradually hired people until there were nine of them. Five years after their successful Malolos operations, the twins opened a branchAt a junction in Plaridel. MaryAnn took charge of managing the branch. Within a fewMonths, the branch showed potentials greater than the Malolos main. The twins were experiencing the joys of a successful venture when Marylou suddenly took a leave to undergo surgery to remove gallstones in her system. The situation forced MaryAnn to simultaneously manage the two outlets. After a while, the cook in Malolos began to experience discomfort in MaryAnn'sManagement style. He complained about the restrictive policies of MaryAnn. He wasScolded several times for doing what he normally did when Marylou was supervised.
