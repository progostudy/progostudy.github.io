                                            [3] In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds." [4] But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. [5] We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. [6] Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children. It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality – 1963 is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. [7] There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright days of justice emerge Question Stop #2: What do you think would happen if their cry for an equitable and just society would result to physical violence in the process?​</a>

Pollution happens when things become dirty or spoiled. Smoggy air is an example of pollution. So is a dirty river. Garbage and waste that is not buried properly causes pollution.

When water on the ground Is hated by the sun, the water vapor rises into the sky and then becomes part of a cloud. Wind carries the cloud across the sky. Water droplets begin to fall from the sky as rain, falling Into puddles, lakes, and oceans on the ground. 4. The yak and camels can help humans. They can carry heavy loads on their backs.

                                            TITLE-The Five Essential Elements of a Story
CHARACTERS: The characters are the individuals that the story is about.The author should introduce the characters in the story with enough information that the reader can visualize each person. This is achieved by providing detailed descriptions of a character’s physical attributes and personality traits. Every story should have a main character. The main character determines the way the plot will
develop and is usually who will solve the problem the story centers upon. However, the other characters are also very important because they supply additional details, explanations, or actions. All characters should stay true to the author’s descriptions throughout the story so that the reader can understand and believe the action that is taking place—and perhaps even predict which character may do what next.
SETTING: The setting is the location of the action. An author should describe the
environment or surroundings of the story in such detail that the reader feels that he
or she can picture the scene. Unusual settings (such as a fantasy world) can be
interesting, but everyday settings can help a reader to better visualize the story and
feel connected to the plot!
PLOT: The plot is the actual story around which the entire book is based. A plot should have a very clear beginning, middle, and end—with all the necessary descriptions and suspense, called exposition—so that the reader can make sense of the action and follow along from start to finish.
CONFLICT: Every story has a conflict to solve. The plot is centered on this conflict and the ways in which the characters attempt to resolve the problem. When the story’s action becomes most exciting, right before the resolution, it is called the climax.
RESOLUTION: The solution to the problem is the way the action is resolved. For
example, Katie often resolves a conflict by finding a compromise for two fighting
characters or helping fix any mistakes she made while switcherooed into someone else.It is important that the resolution fit the rest of the story in tone and creativity and
solve all parts of the conflict.
Guide Questions:
1. Who are the main and supporting characters in the story?
2. When and where did the story take place? Which part of the story reveals the conflict?
3. Why did the judge dismiss the case?
4. What lesson did you learn from the two fathers in the story?
5. Which part of the story shows event that could happen in real life? Why?
6. In the story, what realization in life did you have?</a>

                                            TASK 1. Directions: Create a graphlo organizer, outlining or summarizing the information givenbelow. These are the five key elements of a story.1. Setting: A story's setting refers not only to the physical location, but also the time the action takesplace. It is the where and the when of a story.2. Character: Depending on the nature of the story, characters are most often people or animalsWriters use characters to perform the actions and speak the dialogue of a story. They move a story'plot forward. They are the "who of a story.3. Plot: The plot relates to the events that happen in a story. Plot can be further divided into sub-elements such as: Introduction, rising action, cllmax, falling action, and resolution. It is the 'What ofthe story. Plot usually begins with a problem and ends in the story's resolution4. Conflict: Every story worth its salt requires conflict. This conflict can be thought of as a challengeor problem that drives the action of the story. No conflict, no story. Setting up a series of cause andeffect events, conflict gives those events their why5. Theme: A little more abstract than the previous elements, the theme refers to the underlying insight,the moral or idea that the writer is expressing through the story. It is often thought of as the messageof the story​</a>

                                            Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</a>

Man indeed is in his oblivion of God being the alpha and omega - the beginning and the end. “The man in the poem God said, "I Made A Man" is undoubtedly identical to who this man is nowadays. Despite being God's masterpiece whom God holds dear in His bosom since the time of creation, this man never thought twice of threatening God with a bow. His being ungrateful pained God reminding Him of man's gratification. 'The same pride that led Adam to his downfall forgetting that behind every genius is his fountainhead - God. (sl) 1.

                                            Tennyson's "Crossing the Bar" begins at "Sunset," which is a time of day often used in poetry to symbolize dying or death. Indeed, the sun setting over the horizon, and thus the light of day fading into the dark of night, seems a fitting symbol for the end of a human life.The "bar" mentioned in the poem's title and in the third line of the first stanza refers to a sandbar, and it symbolizes the transition between life and death. The speaker says that he hopes there will be "no moaning of the bar / When (he) put(s) out to sea." The implication here is that he hopes his own transition from life to death will be smooth and without the pain or discomfort implied by the "moaning."In the second stanza, the speaker hopes that his journey towards death, represented in the poem as a journey out to sea, takes place at high tide, when the tide "moving seems asleep" because it is "Too full for sound and foam." In other words, at high tide the water will be smoother and calmer, as the poet hopes his death will be also. The tide here is a fitting symbol for the transition from life to death, because the tide is controlled by the gravitational pull of the moon, thus implying that the speaker's death is inevitable and also that the speaker feels pulled towards his death.In the third stanza, the speaker references the "dark" which will follow sunset. The dark here is a symbol of death and implies that the speaker expects death to be perhaps something like a void.In the final stanza, there are references to water to symbolize the inevitable flow of time. The speaker refers to "Time and Place" as a "bourne," meaning a small stream. He then says that this stream will flow into a "flood" which "may bear (him) far." The flood that the stream flows into here symbolizes the all-consuming nature of death. For every man, the poem implies, the stream of time will eventually flow into and become an all-consuming flood, which in turn will pull each man down to his death.​</a>

                            10. [3] In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds." [4] But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. [5] We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. [6] Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children. It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality – 1963 is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. [7] There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright days of justice emerge Question Stop #2: What do you think would happen if their cry for an equitable and just society would result to physical violence in the process?​</h2><br />

The use of metaphor in comparing a beautiful apple and a candleto the life of a person specially, to the personalities we idolized on social media, is veryeffective. The author successfully has shown parallelism of the objects she used in givingthe value of simple things in life. The author also emphasizes the character's attitude atthe beginning of the story that is shown in sentences numbers 1, 2, and 3 it is a goodtechnique to highlight the problem in the story. The story also highlighted the positiveattitude of the mother that she exhibits patience, wisdom, and love for her daughterIn addition, the story also stressed out the good and bad things of idolizingpersonalities on social media. We need to be wise in everything we belioved on theinternet in general. Life offers us many good things, and we need to be intelligent in everydecision we are making.As a reader, it undoubtedly was shown at the end of the story the author wants toconvey the realization of the daughter of her mistakes and, as she quickly hugged hermother and asked for forgiveness this indicates that the author wants the readers to realizethe importance of asking forgiveness and to be forgiven on the same time,​</h2><br />

                            13. Activity 1: Write True if the statement is correct and False if it is incorrect. Underline the word/s that makes the statement incorrect. (x2) 1. Financial statements are useful to a person who knows how to interpret the infor- mation contained in the report. 2. When making business decisions, an entrepreneur will need various sources of in- formation and a major source of information is the financial statements. 3. A comparison of information from one period to another is called vertical analysis. 4. An analysis of the interrelationships of information in a single period, expressed as a percentage of a common denominator is called horizontal analysis. 5. Entity A reported inventory balances of 100.00 and 50.00 in 20x1 and 20x0, respec- tively. In a horizontal analysis, a financial statement user would conclude that Entity A's inventory has increased by 50% from 20x0 to 20x1. 6. In 20x1, Entity A reported sales of 100.00 and profit of 20.00. In a vertical analysis, a financial statement user would conclude that Entity A was able to generate 20% profit from every pe- so of its sales during the period. 7. At the beginning of the day, you have 200.00 cash in your pocket. At the end of the day, you have 50.00 left. If you make a horizontal analysis of your pocket, you would conclude that your cash has decreased by 80% during the day. 8. Current ratio is computed as current assets less current liabilities to measure an en- tity's liquidity. 9. The quick ratio is also called acid- test ratio has a similar purpose to that of the cur- rent ratio. Use the following information for the next two (2) questions. Entity B has total current assets of 100,000.00 and a total current liabilities of 25,000.00 10. Entity B's current ratio is 4. 11. Entity B's Working Capital is 125,000.00 12. Short term solvency or liquidity refers to an entity's ability to pay its short term obli gations. 13. Activity ratios provide a measure of how efficient a business is utilizing its resourc 14. Solvency is the ability of the company to measure its operating performance as a return on its investment 15. Debt ratio is a solvency ratio that measures business liabilities as a percentage of total assets and its formula is total liabilities over total assets. Activity 2:​</h2><br />

                            21. TITLE-The Five Essential Elements of a Story
CHARACTERS: The characters are the individuals that the story is about.The author should introduce the characters in the story with enough information that the reader can visualize each person. This is achieved by providing detailed descriptions of a character’s physical attributes and personality traits. Every story should have a main character. The main character determines the way the plot will
develop and is usually who will solve the problem the story centers upon. However, the other characters are also very important because they supply additional details, explanations, or actions. All characters should stay true to the author’s descriptions throughout the story so that the reader can understand and believe the action that is taking place—and perhaps even predict which character may do what next.
SETTING: The setting is the location of the action. An author should describe the
environment or surroundings of the story in such detail that the reader feels that he
or she can picture the scene. Unusual settings (such as a fantasy world) can be
interesting, but everyday settings can help a reader to better visualize the story and
feel connected to the plot!
PLOT: The plot is the actual story around which the entire book is based. A plot should have a very clear beginning, middle, and end—with all the necessary descriptions and suspense, called exposition—so that the reader can make sense of the action and follow along from start to finish.
CONFLICT: Every story has a conflict to solve. The plot is centered on this conflict and the ways in which the characters attempt to resolve the problem. When the story’s action becomes most exciting, right before the resolution, it is called the climax.
RESOLUTION: The solution to the problem is the way the action is resolved. For
example, Katie often resolves a conflict by finding a compromise for two fighting
characters or helping fix any mistakes she made while switcherooed into someone else.It is important that the resolution fit the rest of the story in tone and creativity and
solve all parts of the conflict.
Guide Questions:
1. Who are the main and supporting characters in the story?
2. When and where did the story take place? Which part of the story reveals the conflict?
3. Why did the judge dismiss the case?
4. What lesson did you learn from the two fathers in the story?
5. Which part of the story shows event that could happen in real life? Why?
6. In the story, what realization in life did you have?</h2><br />

                            23. Summarize it.
The whole world has come to a standstill, and the reason is
the pandemic COVID-19. All of a sudden, it seems we are a
part of a horror movie. The villainous coronavirus is killing
thousands of people, and we are feeling helpless. It has
turned our lives upside down. Even in our dreams, we could
not have imagined ourselves conned to our homes, with no
outings and unable to meet our friends and relatives.
Reasonably, the situation has given us a chance to look at things dierently. In the beginning, this lockdown was considered as holidays by some children, like me. Once extended,
it has made us realize the value of attending schools. We appreciate the hard work of our
teachers who are trying their best to teach us through online classes and providing us with
study material. Teachers are not leaving any stone unturned so that we do not waste our
precious time sitting idle. Although initially taking online classes was a challenge for them,
they have quickly adapted so that our academic pathdoes not get aected. This has taught
us never to run away from challenges when life throws them upon us and, to try to adapt
according to the situation.
These hard times are teaching us the value of everyday food items like fruits, vegetables,
and groceries in our lives. They have become so valuable that nowadays they are not readily available. We are learning to manage ourselves with limited resources. We have learned
to respect our farmers and the vendors who are bringing these essentials to our doorsteps.
We have realized that we should never waste food because many people are unable to
have even a single meal during this lockdown period. It has also taught us life beyond junk
food as now we know that delicious food can be cooked at home too. We have become
more alert about personal hygiene and cleanliness.
The lockdown has also made us appreciate our parents, who usually work day and night to
fulll our reasonable (and unreasonable) demands and never complain. Spending more
time with them gave us an opportunity to understand them and to learn what quality time

is. Life is about not only studies, TV, and games. It is about sharing and standing with each
other during any phase of life. We have also got a chance to know about our parent’s childhood days, watching Ramayana, Mahabharata, etc. playing games like Ludo. Parents have
also taught us the value of money, and how necessary it is to save money for rainy days. We
have learnt that it is our moral duty to stand by our employees in oces and factories and
domestic help because they are the people who make our life worth living.
The current situation has made us value the organizations who keep working day and night
to make our life easy and smooth. We should be thankful to our government and police o-
cers who are trying to make people follow the rules of social distancing. We should also be
grateful to health workers who are putting their lives in danger to save thousands of lives.
Lockdown is giving us many lessons about life. We have learnt to handle diculties with a
positive mind, and I hope these lessons remain with us throughout life. There is an end to
every nightmare, and this one shall end soon.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Covid-19 Shocked the entire world due to its sudden appearance, it caused chaos and panic among-st nations and governments. 2 years ago non of us imagined that we would be stuck in our homes in lock down yet here we are. It did massive economy damages in all countries and caused major problems and inconvenience to people. However and shined a light on a different point of view. It made us realize the the world is finite, our resources are not limitless and that we should learn and educate ourselves to respect those who work day and night to provide food and water for our nations. We should also thank those who constantly put their selves into danger and sacrifice their lives to find a cure to the current pandemic especially the doctors and front liners. Another thing the lock down taught us is that everything is temporary, Nothing stays the same for long  but when it changes doesn't mean it's gone. The lives that were lost during the pandemic were not in vain, and their legacy and memory will live on. Yes death is inevitable but we shouldn't dwell on what's to come but instead live in the moment and create memories as we go, cherish our loved ones because we will never what the future holds.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps &lt;3</p><br />

                            24. He is Behind Every Genius In today's digitized era, technological advancement enables man not just to survive but also to prosper. ?Non - adherence to this way of life causes him to miss out what the modernized world has to offer. "For his growth's sake, he exhausts himself discovering ways to make him the best labelled as "genius”. Thinking that he knows everything, he ignores the creator who is behind all his triumphs. Man indeed is in his oblivion of God being the alpha and omega - the beginning and the end. “The man in the poem God said, "I Made A Man" is undoubtedly identical to who this man is nowadays. Despite being God's masterpiece whom God holds dear in His bosom since the time of creation, this man never thought twice of threatening God with a bow. His being ungrateful pained God reminding Him of man's gratification. 'The same pride that led Adam to his downfall forgetting that behind every genius is his fountainhead - God. (sl) 1.

                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="tennysons-crossing-the-bar-begins-at-sunset-which-is-a-time-of-day-often-used-in-poetry-to-symbolize-dying-or-death-indeed-the-sun-setting-over-the-horizon-and-thus-the-light-of-day-fading-in">
                            25. Tennyson's "Crossing the Bar" begins at "Sunset," which is a time of day often used in poetry to symbolize dying or death. Indeed, the sun setting over the horizon, and thus the light of day fading into the dark of night, seems a fitting symbol for the end of a human life.The "bar" mentioned in the poem's title and in the third line of the first stanza refers to a sandbar, and it symbolizes the transition between life and death. The speaker says that he hopes there will be "no moaning of the bar / When (he) put(s) out to sea." The implication here is that he hopes his own transition from life to death will be smooth and without the pain or discomfort implied by the "moaning."In the second stanza, the speaker hopes that his journey towards death, represented in the poem as a journey out to sea, takes place at high tide, when the tide "moving seems asleep" because it is "Too full for sound and foam." In other words, at high tide the water will be smoother and calmer, as the poet hopes his death will be also. The tide here is a fitting symbol for the transition from life to death, because the tide is controlled by the gravitational pull of the moon, thus implying that the speaker's death is inevitable and also that the speaker feels pulled towards his death.In the third stanza, the speaker references the "dark" which will follow sunset. The dark here is a symbol of death and implies that the speaker expects death to be perhaps something like a void.In the final stanza, there are references to water to symbolize the inevitable flow of time. The speaker refers to "Time and Place" as a "bourne," meaning a small stream. He then says that this stream will flow into a "flood" which "may bear (him) far." The flood that the stream flows into here symbolizes the all-consuming nature of death. For every man, the poem implies, the stream of time will eventually flow into and become an all-consuming flood, which in turn will pull each man down to his death.​</h2><br />
