                                            TAMA O MALI1. Ayon kay Dr. Florentino Hornedo, ang tao ay isinakatawang diwa, mayroon siyang materyal at espiritwal nadimensiyon.2. Ang kalikasang espiritwal ay nagbibigay ng kakayahang kumilos o gumawa nang nararapat upang mapanatilingmapaunlad ang pamumuhay.3. Ang kalikasang materyal ang nagbibigay ng kakayahang magpasiya patungo sa katotohanan at kabutihan4. Ang kamalayan o consciousness ay mahalaga upang makaramdam ang tao at maging gising sa mga bagay-bagay5. Ang pagpapakatao ay pagsasabuhay ng hindi angkop na pag-iisip, pagpapasiya, pagkilos na nararapat atnaaayon sa kalikasan ng tao.6. Ang karunungan ay bunga ng nahubog na isip at kilos-loob batay sa katotohanan.7. Ang edukasyon ay nagbibigay sa tao ng kakayahang magpasiya at kumilos nang nararapat sa kaniyangkayamanan8. Napakahalaga ng mga pangaral na mababasa sa Banal na Kasulatan o Koran dahil napapaloob dito ang mgaaral ng katotohanan at immoral na batayan ng pamumuhay.9. Ang isip ay umuunawa tungo sa katotohanan at ang kilos-loob ay kumikilos tungo sa kabutihan10. Ang katotohanan ay naipakikita sa mga kabutihan at ito ay natatamo sa pagkakaroon ng mga prinsipyo sabuhay11.

Ang kalikasang espiritwal ay nagbibigay ng kakayahang kumilos o gumawa nang nararapat upang mapanatilingmapaunlad ang pamumuhay.3. Ang kalikasang materyal ang nagbibigay ng kakayahang magpasiya patungo sa katotohanan at kabutihan4. Ang kamalayan o consciousness ay mahalaga upang makaramdam ang tao at maging gising sa mga bagay-bagay5. Ang pagpapakatao ay pagsasabuhay ng hindi angkop na pag-iisip, pagpapasiya, pagkilos na nararapat atnaaayon sa kalikasan ng tao.6. Ang karunungan ay bunga ng nahubog na isip at kilos-loob batay sa katotohanan.7. Ang edukasyon ay nagbibigay sa tao ng kakayahang magpasiya at kumilos nang nararapat sa kaniyangkayamanan8. Napakahalaga ng mga pangaral na mababasa sa Banal na Kasulatan o Koran dahil napapaloob dito ang mgaaral ng katotohanan at immoral na batayan ng pamumuhay.9. Ang isip ay umuunawa tungo sa katotohanan at ang kilos-loob ay kumikilos tungo sa kabutihan10.
