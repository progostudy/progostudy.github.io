                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This calls about the fake news during a bad weather, in which different social media accounts would pretend that they are posting official updates. Next would be the spreading of malicious/scandalous clips of people on the internet. Third, is the unethical opinion of people to others, which can impact the dignity and the rights of others. Fourth, acts of teenangers that would show disrespect and would cause disgrace to the schools and universities. Lastly, too-biased opinions of people, which would likely cause disruption to minds of netizens - making them oppose the other side without hearing their explanations/opinions. That would be all. </p><br />

                            8. reflection about scandal of poverty​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>It's easy to forget that more than a billion people survive on a $1 a day when we live in the world's richest country. Whether in the fields of Africa, the factories of Asia or the streets of our own cities, we often pay scant attention to the abject poverty that degrades our fellow human beings. Ending global poverty is one of the great challenges of our time that requires urgent political will and solidarity with our brothers and sisters around the world.</p><p></p><p>Catholic leaders, economists, international-development experts and activists from several countries will meet in San Francisco tomorrow and Saturday to explore strategies for addressing the moral scandal that is global poverty. We come together to raise awareness, mobilize resources and reflect on how putting faith into action can build a more just world. As Catholics, we pray that we can embrace the hungry, the sick and the suffering as Jesus called us to do with compassion and love. As engaged citizens who understand that foreign policy and budgets are moral endeavors that reflect our values, we call on our leaders to do more to help the world's poor.</p><p>Some ask why we should care about starvation or disease in remote corners of the globe. Along with being the right thing to do, retreating from this cause is also not practical. The forces of globalization have made nations, and their destinies, more interconnected than ever before. As the world's largest economy, the United States has considerable influence to galvanize resources for the poor, push to end curable diseases in Africa and be a model for other countries when it comes to developments.As daunting as the challenge of ending global poverty may seem, this is not an unreachable goal. Renowned poverty expert, Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University, who will deliver the keynote address at our gathering, has identified practical steps such as increasing crop productivity and soil efficiency, providing nutritious school meals and helping poor countries reform internal agencies. We know that governments alone can't solve this problem. Faith-based groups, nonprofit agencies, academics and activists must work together with a renewed sense of urgency. Anything less will lead to more suffering, hunger and death. That's not an option the poor of the world should be expected to endure any longer.</p><p></p><p>HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND ❤️</p><br />

                            9. Why Enron Scandal has caused the Arthur Andersen, one of the top audit firms in the US  to close its business? How was Arthur Andersen involves in the scandal?</h2><br />
                        Arthur Andersen fired its partner in charge of auditing the Enron Corporation today, saying he had ordered the destruction of thousands of documents and e-mail messages after learning that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun an investigation of Enron's accounting.<br /><br />The fired partner, David B. Duncan, called a meeting of auditors at the firm's Houston office and ordered ''an expedited effort to destroy documents'' on Oct. 23, the day after Enron disclosed that the S.E.C. had begun its inquiry, the firm said. The destruction apparently did not end until Mr. Duncan's assistant sent an e-mail message to other secretaries on Nov. 9 that said ''stop the shredding,'' the firm said. Andersen had received a subpoena from the S.E.C. the day before.<br /><br />Further disclosures today underscored the accountants' central role in the scandal surrounding Enron, the pioneering Houston energy company that was the nation's seventh- largest company before its precipitous fall into bankruptcy protection.<br /><br />
