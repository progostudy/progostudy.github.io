Deoxygenated (oxygen-poor) blood from the body enters the right atrium. 2. Blood then flows through right Atrioventricular (AV) valve going to right ventricle. 3. Contraction of right ventricle pushes the pulmonary valve open. With that, blood moves through pulmonary valve to pulmonary trunk. 4. Then it is dispersed by right and left pulmonary arteries to both right and left lungs, where it drops off Carbon dioxide (CO2) and picks up oxygen (O2). 5. Oxygenated (oxygen-rich) blood from lungs returns thru pulmonary arteries going to left atrium. 6. From there, it flows through left Atrioventricular (AV) valve into left ventricle. 7. Contraction of left ventricle makes the aortic valve open. This makes blood flow to aorta. 8. It is then disseminated to every structure in the body, where it unloads O2 and loads CO. 9. Blood reverts to heart thru vena cava.​</a>

There are many wiring connections in a parallel circuit.2.. The electric current in the parallel circuit remains the same to all its paths.3. One of the advantages of the parallel circuit is that the appliances or the bulbsoperate independently.4. If more bulbs will be added to the parallel circuit, the light of the bulbs will dim.5. In a parallel circuit using a dry cell, all wires for the positive terminal should beconnected to the positive terminal of the dry cell.6.. Circuit - A closed continuous path for electricity to flow. Composed of powersource, connecting wires, load, and switch.7. Resistance - The restriction or opposition to the flow of electric current.8. voltage is the amount of potential energy available (work to be done) per unit charge, to move chargesthrough a conductor.9..

It plays on the human urge to fit in and not feel excluded. It generates a sense of social pressure by hinting that not joining the group means missing out on something.</p><p></p><p>16.) <strong>Bandwagon</strong> - The advertiser in this case is employing the bandwagon tactic to persuade individuals to join Sprint's network.

Deoxygenated (oxygen-poor) blood from the body enters the right atrium. 2. Blood then flows through right Atrioventricular (AV) valve going to right ventricle. 3. Contraction of right ventricle pushes the pulmonary valve open. With that, blood moves through pulmonary valve to pulmonary trunk. 4. Then it is dispersed by right and left pulmonary arteries to both right and left lungs, where it drops off Carbon dioxide (CO2) and picks up oxygen (O2). 5. Oxygenated (oxygen-rich) blood from lungs returns thru pulmonary arteries going to left atrium. 6. From there, it flows through left Atrioventricular (AV) valve into left ventricle. 7. Contraction of left ventricle makes the aortic valve open. This makes blood flow to aorta. 8. It is then disseminated to every structure in the body, where it unloads O2 and loads CO. 9.
