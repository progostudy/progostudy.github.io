But, despite their lack of money, his parents raised him to be helpful and kind to everyone. One day, Nico was asked by his mother to buy some groceries at the supermarket. While he was walking along the aisle of the store, he suddenly remembered that it was his grandmother's birthday! She's already old so Nico wants to buy a simple birthday present for her to make her happy. He reached for his coin pouch and counted his money. Unfortunately, he doesn't have any spare to buy a gift for her grandma. A man standing on a corner noticed Nico's sad face. He figured out the poor boy's problem so he came closer to him and gave him a box of nicely baked cupcakes Nico was surprised! The man who gave him cupcakes was Mr. Ramos, the Chief-of-police. Nico knew him when he did some cleaning work at the police station for some extra money. He immediately thanked him. But, instead of saying "You're welcome", Mr. Ramos simply said, "Stay kind and helpful young boy. I hope your grandma likes the cupcakes. pls help me??I don't know the answer can you help me​</a>

She knew she should have listened to her mother when she was explaining how to wrap presents. It was her best friend Amy’s birthday and the party was in two hours. How would she ever get the gifts to look nice before then? The boxes she had wrapped looked like her two-year-old brother had wrapped them. Even the card she had written and signed looked messy. Sarah took a deep breath. As much as she wanted to wrap the gifts all by herself, she swallowed her pride, but still undecided, called for her mother. When her mother walked-in she took one glance at the gifts and said, “Look like it’s time for a redo!”With her mother’s help Sarah slowly rewrapped each present and retied each bow listening carefully to each direction. Her mother even helped her remake the card. Sarah rewrote the message and added sparkly stickers to the paper. “Thanks, mom,” Sarah said. “I couldn’t have done this without you. I guess I learned my lessons. I should have listened to you the first time. Thanks for helping me redo everything.” “No problem,” mom said. “All of us need a redo every now and then.” When Sarah arrived at the party, she had the best-wrapped presents on the table. “Thank you for the gift, Sarah. You are such an adorable friend,” Amy exclaimed.         Let’s Talk!1. Who was the girl in the selection? __________________________________2.

                                            Blindfolded
By: Anonymous
Naina was thoroughly enjoying her outing with her parents. After all the excitement at the amusement park, she persuaded her parents to have an ice cream before they headed home. She was relishing her ice cream when suddenly, she was pushed by someone. The ice cream fell from her hand onto her dress. She turned back and hollered, “Are you blind? Can’t you see and walk properly?” To everyone’s surprise, the person who had bumped into her was indeed a little blind boy. He apologized immediately, but Naina was so enraged that she started shouting and threw a tantrum. The blind boy moved away quietly with tears in his eyes.
Three months later, it was Naina’s birthday. Her parents had planned a surprise, but there was a condition – she had to be blindfolded all day or she wouldn’t get her surprise. She readily agreed. First, they went to her favorite restaurant. She wanted to take the blindfold off, but her parents refused saying that a bigger surprise was awaiting her. She ate her food half-heartedly, as she could only taste and smell the food, but could not see it. After lunch, they took her to a movie. Even there, her parents did not remove her blindfold. So, she could only hear the sounds but not see the film. She stared, feeling irritated and depressed. Finally, her parents took her to the place where her surprise was waiting. Someone opened a door and asked them to sit down.
The moment of surprise had finally come. Her blindfold was removed. She found it difficult to adjust her eyes to the lights around her. Once she could see, she saw a blindfolded boy sitting in front of her. There was a bandage tied around his eyes and a doctor was removing it. She recognized the boy. He was the same little blind boy who had pushed her while having ice cream. As the boy opened his eyes, he saw Naina. He shouted excitedly, “I can see”! The doctor said, pointing at Naina, “This is Naina, the one who has donated money for your eye operation.” Naina couldn’t believe her ears. She didn’t have words to express the entire incident with the ice cream. The way she had reacted ran through her mind. She shivered at the thought of how she had spent her day blindfolded . . . but before she could say anything, the little boy came running over and hugged her saying, “Thank you, Naina.” She hugged him back and said, “You are the biggest surprise I have ever got. Thank you for opening my eyes.”What will you do if your employer asks you to carry an oversized load?

                                            Please answer asap thank you!!        One day a boy asked his daddy, “Dad what are you going to give me on my birthday?” The father replied, “Son, there is much time left.” A few days before his birthday, the boy fainted and was rushed to the hospital. He was diagnosed of a kidney problem and his parents found out that he was probably going to die. When he was lying on the hospital bed he said, “Daddy, have they told you I am going to die?” The father replied, “No, you will live!” As he left, the weeping child then asked, “How can you be so sure?” He turned around and said, “I know.” The son eventually celebrated his birthday and continued to live. Obviously, the father prayed for his child to continue to live. Prayer strengthens and makes us certain in all things. All we need is to fully trust and believe that God will listen to us and grant our needs like in the story of Abraham. He trusted God’s word, and God rewarded his faith.

She's already old so Nico wants to buy a simple birthday present for her to make her happy. He reached for his coin pouch and counted his money.

He figured out the poor boy's problem so he came closer to him and gave him a box of nicely baked cupcakes Nico was surprised! The man who gave him cupcakes was Mr. Ramos, the Chief-of-police.

                            6. Sarah stared at the mess she had made on the floor. In her disappointment she wanted to throw everything and forget what she was doing. She knew she should have listened to her mother when she was explaining how to wrap presents. It was her best friend Amy’s birthday and the party was in two hours. How would she ever get the gifts to look nice before then? The boxes she had wrapped looked like her two-year-old brother had wrapped them. Even the card she had written and signed looked messy. Sarah took a deep breath. As much as she wanted to wrap the gifts all by herself, she swallowed her pride, but still undecided, called for her mother. When her mother walked-in she took one glance at the gifts and said, “Look like it’s time for a redo!”With her mother’s help Sarah slowly rewrapped each present and retied each bow listening carefully to each direction. Her mother even helped her remake the card. Sarah rewrote the message and added sparkly stickers to the paper. “Thanks, mom,” Sarah said. “I couldn’t have done this without you. I guess I learned my lessons. I should have listened to you the first time. Thanks for helping me redo everything.” “No problem,” mom said. “All of us need a redo every now and then.” When Sarah arrived at the party, she had the best-wrapped presents on the table. “Thank you for the gift, Sarah. You are such an adorable friend,” Amy exclaimed.         Let’s Talk!1. Who was the girl in the selection? __________________________________2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Ang Ikalawang Digmaang Pandaigdig ay isang pandaigdigang labanán na nagsimula noong ika-1 ng Setyembre taóng 1939. Natapos ito noong ika-2 ng Setyembre 1945, at nasangkot ang karamihan ng mga bansa sa daigdig at bawat kontinente na may naninirahan. Tinuturing ito na pinakamalawak, pinakamahal at pinakamadugong labanán sa kasaysayan ng sangkatauhan. Maaalalang ang mga bansang lumahok sa digmaan ay nagbuhos ng napakaraming puwersang militar upang lupigin ang bawat kalaban. Isang linggo bago magsimula ang digmaan, ang kasunduang Molotov-Ribbentrop ay nilagdaan ng dalawang magkakalaban, ang Alemanyang Nazi at ang Unyong Sobyet at sumang-ayon sila sa dibisyon ng teritoryong nais sakupin sa Poland. Nagsimula lumusob ang hukbong Alemanya sa kanluran, hilaga, at timog ng Poland noong Setyembre 1, 1939 habang ang USSR ay nagsimulang lumusob sa bansa noong Setyembre 17 sa silangang bahagi ng Poland. Nang sumuko ang Poland, sila'y pinalipat sa Romania. Ang hukbong Nazi ay aktibo sa digmaan mula 1939 hanggang 1940 at halos nakontrol ang maraming bansa sa Europa. Pumasok ang Italya sa digmaan noong June 10, 1940 upang tulungan ang mga Alemanya. Ang mga bansang Pransiya, Belhika, Netherlands, Austria, Tsekoslobakya, Poland, Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, at kanlurang Rusya ay nakontrol ng Alemanya sa panahong iyon. Pumasok ang Asia sa digmaan noong Disyembre 7, 1941 nang binomba ng Japan ang Pearl Harbor sa Hawaii sa umaga. Nagbibigay-daan din ito sa pagpasok ng bansang United States sa digmaan. Habang nangyari ang pag-atake sa Pearl Harbor, ang walong barkong U.S. Navy ships ay binagsak ng mga Hapon. Inilarawan itong bilang ''a date which will live in infamy'' dahil nangyari ang pag-atake ng walang anunsyo o deklarasyon. Pagkatapos ng pitong oras, nagsimulang umatake ang Japan sa mga bansang nasa timog-silangang Asia tulad ng Pilipinas, Hong kong, at Singapore. Halos nakontrol ng mga Hapon ang mga bansa sa timog-silangang Asia at ang mga taong nakatira sa mga ito ay pinahirapan at pinatay. Noong 1943, sinalakay ng mga Alyado ang Sicily, ang isla sa timog ng Italy hanggang sa sumuko ang Italy sa pamamagitan ng paglagda ng kasunduang Cassibile noong Setyembre 3 at dineklara sa Setyembre 8. Noong Abril 16, 1945, nangyari ang labanan sa Berlin at ito'y pinakahuling labanan ng hukbong Alemnya at USSR. Habang nangyari ang labanan na ito, noong Abril 30, si Adolf Hitler ay nagpakamatay sa pamamagitan ng pagbabaril sa ulo at kasabay niya rito ang asawa niyang si Eva Braun na nagpakamatay din sa pamamagitan ng paggamit ng cyanide. Sa pagkamatay ni Hitler, humina ang Nazi Germany at marami sa kanila ang namamatay sa daan. Sumuko ang mga Alemanya noong Mayo 7, 1945 at bunga nito, nanalo ang USSR. Pagkatapos nito, nagkaroon ng selebrasyon sa Europa. Mula Moscow hanggang Los Angeles, nagkaroon sila ng malaking selebrasyon. Ang hukbong USSR ay nabigyan ng award sa kanilang tagumpay, ''Heroes of the Soviet Union''. Noong Agosto 6 at 9, nagsimulang magbomba ang mga hukbong Amerikano sa mga lungsod ng Hiroshima at Nagasaki. Ang bombang Little Boy ay ginamit sa Hiroshima at ang bombang Fat Man sa Nagasaki. Maraming namatay sa mga Hapon hanggang sila'y sumuko noong Agosto 15, 1945. Upang mabigyang opisyal na katapusan ang Ikalawang Digmaang Pandaigdig, ang dokumentong pagsuko ay nilagdaan ng mga Hapon noong Setyembre 2, 1945. Sa pagtapos ng digmaan, 60 milyon tao ang nasawi.<br />

                            24. Blindfolded
By: Anonymous
Naina was thoroughly enjoying her outing with her parents. After all the excitement at the amusement park, she persuaded her parents to have an ice cream before they headed home. She was relishing her ice cream when suddenly, she was pushed by someone. The ice cream fell from her hand onto her dress. She turned back and hollered, “Are you blind? Can’t you see and walk properly?” To everyone’s surprise, the person who had bumped into her was indeed a little blind boy. He apologized immediately, but Naina was so enraged that she started shouting and threw a tantrum. The blind boy moved away quietly with tears in his eyes.
Three months later, it was Naina’s birthday. Her parents had planned a surprise, but there was a condition – she had to be blindfolded all day or she wouldn’t get her surprise. She readily agreed. First, they went to her favorite restaurant. She wanted to take the blindfold off, but her parents refused saying that a bigger surprise was awaiting her. She ate her food half-heartedly, as she could only taste and smell the food, but could not see it. After lunch, they took her to a movie. Even there, her parents did not remove her blindfold. So, she could only hear the sounds but not see the film. She stared, feeling irritated and depressed. Finally, her parents took her to the place where her surprise was waiting. Someone opened a door and asked them to sit down.
The moment of surprise had finally come. Her blindfold was removed. She found it difficult to adjust her eyes to the lights around her. Once she could see, she saw a blindfolded boy sitting in front of her. There was a bandage tied around his eyes and a doctor was removing it. She recognized the boy. He was the same little blind boy who had pushed her while having ice cream. As the boy opened his eyes, he saw Naina. He shouted excitedly, “I can see”! The doctor said, pointing at Naina, “This is Naina, the one who has donated money for your eye operation.” Naina couldn’t believe her ears. She didn’t have words to express the entire incident with the ice cream. The way she had reacted ran through her mind. She shivered at the thought of how she had spent her day blindfolded . . . but before she could say anything, the little boy came running over and hugged her saying, “Thank you, Naina.” She hugged him back and said, “You are the biggest surprise I have ever got. Thank you for opening my eyes.”What will you do if your employer asks you to carry an oversized load?

                            26. Please answer asap thank you!!        One day a boy asked his daddy, “Dad what are you going to give me on my birthday?” The father replied, “Son, there is much time left.” A few days before his birthday, the boy fainted and was rushed to the hospital. He was diagnosed of a kidney problem and his parents found out that he was probably going to die. When he was lying on the hospital bed he said, “Daddy, have they told you I am going to die?” The father replied, “No, you will live!” As he left, the weeping child then asked, “How can you be so sure?” He turned around and said, “I know.” The son eventually celebrated his birthday and continued to live. Obviously, the father prayed for his child to continue to live. Prayer strengthens and makes us certain in all things. All we need is to fully trust and believe that God will listen to us and grant our needs like in the story of Abraham. He trusted God’s word, and God rewarded his faith. Describe the father-son relationship as shown in the following dialogues:a. “Dad, what are you going to give me on my birthday?”_________________________________________________________________________________b. “Daddy have they told you I am going to die?”_________________________________________________________________________________c. “How can you be so sure?”_________________________________________________________________________________If you were the son, how would you take your father’s answer?__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
