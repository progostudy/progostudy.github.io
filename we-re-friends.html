                                            VIRTUES AMIDST THE PANDEMIC "At the end of the day, all we need is hope and faith." The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been a tragedy for our community and country. With so many parts of our lives that turned upside down, we have to adapt to the "new normal" as our new re ity. Despite the un certainties associated with this crisis, we have seen communities around the world generating hope. Hope provides a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind, even in tragic situations. To have hope, it is important that we feel a sense of meaning in our lives. - In the recent months, we have learned to appreciate two things that give our life meaning - work and connection with friends and family. This pandemic has caused anxieties, fear, and uncertainties. Raising community awareness of mental health issues helps promote a more positive and proactive approach to addressing mental illnesses in this time of pandemic. However, we are capable to be courageous, hopeful, and resilient as we pray for healing around the world. COVID-19 can be considered a blessing in disguise as we look on the brighter side. Because of this global health crisis, we have also learned to value simple things in life. All have been required to stay at home and be with the family. Everyone has started to help each other; family ties have been strengthened. Busy streets and some malls were closed. As a result, pollution was lessened and Mother Earth started to recuperate. We have also realized the importance of hygiene and safety health protocols. The usual daily routine at home and workplace has been changed. Most importantly, we have brought ourselves back again to the Lord and regained our spiritual attachment with Him. This is an awakening call for us to never give up and to see hope in the middle of challenges.what virtue to provide a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind in tragic situations?​</a>

Then, choose the correct answer from the given choices.PAINHow do we sense pain? The human body has nociceptors to receive an electrical impulse that is sent to part of the brain that recognizes pain. Memories of these sensations are formed to help us avoid painful objects and experiences and prevents us from repeating past mistakes that may have hurt us in some way. But pain is more complex. It is not only a physical experience but an emotional and psychological one as well. When all of these come together, it is called suffering. The mind is not alone in recognizing pain. The nervous system is also able to store such information. Even when a person loses a finger or a limb, the pain that was once felt may become a chronic one- one that keeps recurring. The best way to avoid this is to prevent pain memories from forming. The use of anesthesia prevents the mind from creating these memories. Drugs that prevent pain such as analgesics help lessen the pain sensed.1. What are "nociceptors?"a. electrical impulsesc. nerve receptorsb. memories of paind. sensations of pain2. How do memories of pain help us?a. These constantly remind us of what hurts..b. These help dull the senses.c. These help us re-experience the pain.d.

                            13. VIRTUES AMIDST THE PANDEMIC "At the end of the day, all we need is hope and faith." The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been a tragedy for our community and country. With so many parts of our lives that turned upside down, we have to adapt to the "new normal" as our new re ity. Despite the un certainties associated with this crisis, we have seen communities around the world generating hope. Hope provides a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind, even in tragic situations. To have hope, it is important that we feel a sense of meaning in our lives. - In the recent months, we have learned to appreciate two things that give our life meaning - work and connection with friends and family. This pandemic has caused anxieties, fear, and uncertainties. Raising community awareness of mental health issues helps promote a more positive and proactive approach to addressing mental illnesses in this time of pandemic. However, we are capable to be courageous, hopeful, and resilient as we pray for healing around the world. COVID-19 can be considered a blessing in disguise as we look on the brighter side. Because of this global health crisis, we have also learned to value simple things in life. All have been required to stay at home and be with the family. Everyone has started to help each other; family ties have been strengthened. Busy streets and some malls were closed. As a result, pollution was lessened and Mother Earth started to recuperate. We have also realized the importance of hygiene and safety health protocols. The usual daily routine at home and workplace has been changed. Most importantly, we have brought ourselves back again to the Lord and regained our spiritual attachment with Him. This is an awakening call for us to never give up and to see hope in the middle of challenges.what virtue to provide a positive vision and an optimistic state of mind in tragic situations?​</h2><br />

                            27. READING INTERVENTION NO. 7Direction: Read the following selection carefully. Then, choose the correct answer from the given choices.PAINHow do we sense pain? The human body has nociceptors to receive an electrical impulse that is sent to part of the brain that recognizes pain. Memories of these sensations are formed to help us avoid painful objects and experiences and prevents us from repeating past mistakes that may have hurt us in some way. But pain is more complex. It is not only a physical experience but an emotional and psychological one as well. When all of these come together, it is called suffering. The mind is not alone in recognizing pain. The nervous system is also able to store such information. Even when a person loses a finger or a limb, the pain that was once felt may become a chronic one- one that keeps recurring. The best way to avoid this is to prevent pain memories from forming. The use of anesthesia prevents the mind from creating these memories. Drugs that prevent pain such as analgesics help lessen the pain sensed.1. What are "nociceptors?"a. electrical impulsesc. nerve receptorsb. memories of paind. sensations of pain2.
