What do you know about prefixes? ✔A prefix is a group of letters that go in front of the word. A prefix changes the meaning of a word. Most of the time a prefix is not a word by itself, but not always. When you peel away the prefix, a base word that makes sense is left. Circle each prefix. Then write the base word. 11. unthread 12. replay 13. impolite 14. disappear 15. pretest 16. uncover 17. midair 18. supercharge 19. nonvoter 20. intertwine N The prefix de means to make less or remove. The prefix re means again or back. Change the meaning of the word in bold print by adding the prefix re or de. Write the word on the line. 21. Before taking off, the plane had to be iced. 22. The table is old so it needs to be painted. 23. It was such a wonderful day I wish I could live it. 24. I need to place the stone that is missing from my ring. Oh, hella-o-o!

Make sure you look up in the dictionary any words with which you are not familiar.3. After reading the work the first time, ask yourself the following questions:                    QUESTIONS• What is the geographical, historical and social setting? How does this affect the story or poem?• Who is (are) the main character(s)?• Who are the secondary characters, and how are they linked to the main characters?• Does the main character change? If so, how and why? If not, why not?• What is the conflict? Can you trace the development and resolution of the conflict?• Who is telling the story? How does this influence the story or poem?• In poetry, can you find a pattern of rime and meter?4. As you re-read the work, make sure you can answer these questions.

What do they mean?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>• Who is (are) the main character(s)?</p><p></p><p>-The main character in the myth Pandora's Box was Pandora becaue she was the one that propelled the story forward. Pandora was a clay woman who was created by Zeus in order to punish human.</p><p></p><p>• Who are the secondary characters, and how are they linked to the main characters?</p><p></p><p>- Zeus could be an epic hero because of his physical appearance. However, he didn’t fit the position in this story. In Pandora’s Box, he was acted as an antagonist; therefore, he was a villain that blocked Pandora from driving forward the story and his actions in this story corresponded to the characteristics for the villain.</p><p></p><p></p><p>• Does the main character change? If so, how and why? If not, why not?</p><p></p><p>-Pandora opened a jar left in her care containing sickness, death and many other unspecified evils which were then released into the world. ... From this story has grown the idiom "to open a Pandora's box", meaning to do or start something that will cause many unforeseen problems.</p><p></p><p></p><p>• What is the conflict? Can you trace the development and resolution of the conflict?</p><p></p><p>-The conflict is when the 2 brothers continue to upset and enrage Zeus leading to him punishing the humans. Next are the rising action and climax. The rising actions are when Zeus creates Pandora. When Pandora marries Epimetheus, and when Zeus gives Pandora a box for her wedding gift.</p><p></p><p>• Who is telling the story? How does this influence the story or poem?</p><p></p><p>-Pandora's box is an artifact in Greek mythology connected with the myth of Pandora in Hesiod's Works and Days.[1] In modern times an idiom has grown from it meaning "Any source of great and unexpected troubles",[2] or alternatively "A present which seems valuable but which in reality is a curse".[3] Later depictions of the fatal container have been varied, while some literary and artistic treatments have focused more on the contents of the idiomatic box than on Pandora herself. The container mentioned in the original story was actually a large storage jar but the word was later mistranslated as "box".</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
