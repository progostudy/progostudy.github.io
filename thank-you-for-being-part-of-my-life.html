I just can’t help myself but to share to you a very beautiful
encounter I personally witnessed as I go to work.
You know, I have read a lot of posts in social media about cops
who become abusive of their power. One video that I watched
shows police brutality towards a bystander who allegedly
violated a protocol in this time of the pandemic. For not wearing
a mask, he was immediately detained. Others raged and asked
‘Could he be just fined?’ There was another
post about a ‘ginang’ who was accordingly detained after
having argued with a policeman. And many awkward and
untoward stories continue to surface that painted a bad image to our policemen.
I do not say that these stories are not true. But what I am pointing out here is
the fact that while some other policemen seem bad and abusive, majority of them
are not and are still working under their oath, that is to protect people from crimes.
One of the many good policemen happened to be the character of this good
encounter of mine.
I was on my way to work. It was difficult for me to flag down a taxi since it was
raining on that morning. I tried several times but the cabs could not just see me for
that part of the waiting shed was hidden by some trees plus the bad weather fog
seemed to darken that street. One, two, three, four times that I tried but still I could
not take one. I would be terribly late.
I was already hopeless when suddenly a police mobile came out from nowhere
and stopped at the side of the street. A man in uniform then came out from the car. I
guessed he was at his mid-40s.He had no umbrella but thank God the rain on that
moment wasn’t that hard to bathe him soon. He smiled at me and when he noticed
that a taxi was approaching, he made a sign for it to stop. It stopped. But what
surprised me and I didn’t expect more is when he took off his uniform and enveloped
me with it. So, I didn’t get moistened by rain as I got inside the cab. I thanked him for
his kindness and secretly read the name on his plate. ‘Macapagal, L.M.’ was
engraved on it. He nodded at me and assured that I owe nothing for his kindness.
He waved then as the car began to run. I will not forget that act of kindness.
When I reached home, I overheard our maids in the kitchen gigglingly talked
about a man who helped them carry their groceries after being stuck in the rain this
afternoon. According to Aling Carmen, our old maid, she would not surely forget the
name of that police guy for the rest of her life. As it was her first to receive such
kindness from a man of her dreams. But Aling Tessie, our jolly cook, teased Aling
Carmen that the police guy was only meant for herself and not for Aling Carmen.
And both of them giggled even more. When I asked them who this ‘knight with a
shining armor’ is they were talking about, both of them screamed ‘Macapagal, L.M!’
So, you see, it was the same guy who helped me earlier. Wow! It was just natural for that police guy to help! May many beautiful encounters continue to spread down the street!
