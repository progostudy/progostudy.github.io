They spent their days helping out the colony, working hard to collect food and bring it back into their ant hill. They loved playing games in their spare time. One day the boys had an argument. Jerry was playing with another ant called Peter and Andy got Jealous. He ran over to Jerry and told him he couldn't play with anyone else. Jerry didn't like being told what to do so he ignored Andy and kept on playing with Pater. Andy got very upeet. He had been friends with Jerry for a long time and now Jerry didn't want to play with him. So Andy decided to walk home by himself, feeling lonely and ead. He was so upset that he wasn't looking where he was going and suddenly he fell into a huge puddlel Andy didn't know how to swim and he quickly started sinking to the bottom of the water. Peter saw that Andy was in trouble and ran over to save him, with Jerry following close behind. He found a stick and held it out into the water for Andy to grab hold of.

Long, long time ago, Arojo, a young and mighty giant, fell in love with an ordinarymortal girl named Aloya. When this girl died, giant Arojo cried so bitterly that hisviews then turned into mounds of earth. These eventually became heroes asasting proof of his grief, now known as, the Chocolate Hills.6. According to legends, the Chocolate Hills existed because of a weeping giantwho had been disappointed in love, and the hills grew where his tears fell.

When he reached there he did not see anyone around. He wanted to meet everyone and make new friends. So, the frog climbed a high rock by the lake and said, "Friends, please come here. I am new here. I want to meet all of you. I have come from the village." Many animals heard his voice and came to the lake. The deer, the tortoise, the duck, the rabbit, the birds, the squirrel, the butterfly, and the fox came there. The frog said, "Let me introduce myself. I am Dr. Croaky. I am a doctor who can cure any ailment that you might be suffering from. I have medicines for all animals' diseases. You can come to meet me anytime." Hearing this, the fox said, "If you can cure everyone then why haven't you cured your lame legs? See how you keep hopping around all the time." All the animals and birds laughed at the frog. The frog went red with shame for his lie had been detected.

your gentle touch and soothing voice make all my fears just melt away.

If you allow it the film can even move your heart.If you liked Kita Kita, then l' assure you that you'rdig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as welland get the "I want to watch it againl"feeling.2.Loser to ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters' journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel showswriting poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed atbecause of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and thatsame inspiration is not enough to win a gid or to have a happy ending. Santos'sperformance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreakingconfrontation scene: 'Friendzoned' right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella,who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She's effortless even if she is playing afrustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in rollercoaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hafing her, but I realized she'san epitome of a character we need to embracel3."100 Tula Para kay Stella" is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about afreshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to expresshis love for the campus rock star, Stella, When in college, they become close friends.When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confesshis love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that tumed into "love", but it's not atypical love story that we've seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90's FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there's the element of nostalgia in the film, resonatingwith the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of thevintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98' Degreesand Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya's "Balisong", it displays the time when Pinoy RockBands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting atthe same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the "I want to watch this!" feeling. At first, when I heard it frommy classmates. I thought it would be about 'spoken poetry' which has been in socialmedia platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino(PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6.Catharsis in NostalgiaBy Abigail Eclavea7.It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh andnew to movie audiences. 100 Tula Para kay Stella' gives the idea that mainstreamand indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardlypresent in mainstream cinema.I love that there's more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirablecharacters and the 2000's vibes.​</a>

                                            Activity 15: Speech WritingPlease refer to the Practical Task.GUIDED GENERALIZATIONIdentify what type of speech is used in the following:1.___________________________________________________________________ Did you know that during the first months of 2004, approximately 200 million birds died or were destroyed in attempt to stop the pandemic of avian influenza? Did you hear that United Nations contributor, Dr. David Navarro, estimated the number of possible human casualties as 5 – 150 million people? Are you aware that since its discovery in the 1990”s, the avian flu has been contracted by more than 100 people, and one of them died? (www.speech.guru)2._____________________________________________________________________ I will finish my speech by one of my favourite quotations. It is taken from the book written by a brilliant mathematician who dared to believe in the incredible. You must have read it in your childhood, but I want you to recall, re-evaluate and remember it. “There is no use trying, said Alice; one can’t believe impossible things. I dare say you haven’t had much practice, said the Queen. When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast” (Louis Carol).3._________________________________________________________________________ The process itself falls into four simple steps. First, ensure that the wide end of the knot is approximately 30 cm lower than the narrow end and cross the wide end over the narrow one. This will create a loop between the collar and your will-be-tie. Pass the wide end through this loop and then down. So the wide end will again be on top of the narrow one4.__________________________________________________________________________How many of you think guns are necessary to protect yourself? Would you feel the same way if you knew how often guns kill children? I don’t think so! Magazines usually tell people how beautiful and powerful guns are, and never mention how many children get hurt by guns every 0day. But I am here to ask all of you to oppose gun ownership because the fact is that guns are a weapon of violence, they take more lives away every year, and they make people blind to the fact they are killing their own children.5.___________________________________________________________________________The term OCD consists of two defining words: obsession and compulsion. As the word “disorder” speaks for itself, defining obsession and compulsion is crucial for understanding this problem. According to the Merriam-? Webster dictionary, obsession is a persistent disturbing pre-occupation with an often unreasonable idea or feeling. Compulsion, in its turn, is an irresistible, persistent impulse to perform an act-often to deal with the obsession. An OCD can be defined as a condition of the mind characterized by a constantly repeating intrusive thought, which can be neutralized only by a certain act or ritual (academichelp.net)​</a>

                                            ACTIVITY 2: WRITING THE BODY PARAGRAPH 
Resource: Handbook for Writers by Lynn Q. Troyka 
The cockroach lore that has been daunting us for years is mostly true. Roaches can live for twenty days without food, fourteen days without water; They can flatten their bodies and crawl through a crack thinner than a centavo; they can eat huge doses of carcinogens and still die of old age. They can even survive “as much radiation as an oak tree can,” says William Bell, the University of Kansas entomologist whose cockroaches appeared in the movie The Day After. They will eat almost anything--- regular food, leather, glue, hair, paper, even the starch in the bookbinding. (The New York public Library has quite a cockroach problem.) They sense the slightest breeze, and they can react and start running in .05 second; they can also remain motionless for days. And if all this isn’t creepy enough, they can fly too. 
－Jane Goldman, “What’s Bugging You?”

1. There are three characteristics of an effective body paragraph: Unity, development, and coherence. 
• Unity is achieved when you have made a clear connection between the main idea of the paragraph and sentences that support the main idea. 
• Development refers to the detailed and sufficient support you give to the main idea. 
• Coherence refers to how smoothly, and logically you progress from one sentence to the next. 
2. Use the RENNS Test to check whether you are providing sufficient detail to your body paragraph. RENNS stands for Reasons, examples, names, numbers, and senses. 
Study Guide Question (s): 
1. How does the paragraph begin? 
2. What is highlighted in sentences 2 to 8?

If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2.Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6.Catharsis in NostalgiaBy Abigail Eclavea7.It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardly present in mainstream cinema.I love that there’s more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirable characters and the 2000’s vibes.pa help naman​</a>

I will love you as a drawer loves a secret compartment, and as a secret compartment loves a secret, and as a secret loves to make a person gasp, and as a gasping person loves a glass of brandy to calm their nerves, and as a glass of brandy loves to shatter on the floor, and as the noise of glass shattering loves to make someone else gasp, and as someone else gasping loves a nearby desk to lean against, even if leaning against it presses a lever that loves to open a drawer and reveal a secret compartment. I will love you until all such compartments are discovered and opened, and until all the secrets have gone gasping into the world. I will love you until all the codes and hearts have been broken and until every anagram and egg has been unscrambled.I will love you until every fire is extinguised and until every home is rebuilt from the handsomest and most susceptible of woods, and until every criminal is handcuffed by the laziest of policemen. I will love until M. hates snakes and J. hates grammar, and I will love you until C. realizes S. is not worthy of his love and N. realizes he is not worthy of the V. I will love you until the bird hates a nest and the worm hates an apple, and until the apple hates a tree and the tree hates a nest, and until a bird hates a tree and an apple hates a nest, although honestly I cannot imagine that last occurrence no matter how hard I try. I will love you as we grow older, which has just happened, and has happened again, and happened several days ago, continuously, and then several years before that, and will continue to happen as the spinning hands of every clock and the flipping pages of every calendar mark the passage of time, except for the clocks that people have forgotten to wind and the calendars that people have forgotten to place in a highly visible area. I will love you as we find ourselves farther and farther from one another, where we once we were so close that we could slip the curved straw, and the long, slender spoon, between our lips and fingers respectively.I will love you until the chances of us running into one another slip from slim to zero, and until your face is fogged by distant memory, and your memory faced by distant fog, and your fog memorized by a distant face, and your distance distanced by the memorized memory of a foggy fog. I will love you no matter where you go and who you see, no matter where you avoid and who you don’t see, and no matter who sees you avoiding where you go. I will love you no matter what happens to you, and no matter how I discover what happens to you, and no matter what happens to me as I discover this, and now matter how I am discovered after what happens to me as I am discovering this.Where is this from?​</a>

When he reached there he did not see anyone around. He wanted to meet everyone and make new friends. So, the frog climbed a high rock by the lake and said, "Friends, please come here. I am new here. I want to meet all of you. I have come from the village." Many animals heard his voice and came to the lake. The deer, the tortoise, the duck, the rabbit, the birds, the squirrel, the butterfly, and the fox came there. The frog said, "Let me introduce myself. I am Dr. Croaky. I am a doctor who can cure any ailment that you might be suffering from. I have medicines for all animals' diseases. You can come to meet me anytime." Hearing this, the fox said, "If you can cure everyone then why haven't you cured your lame legs? See how you keep hopping around all the time." All the animals and birds laughed at the frog. The frog went red with shame for his lie had been detected.

If you allow it the film can even move your heart.If you liked Kita Kita, then l' assure you that you'rdig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as welland get the "I want to watch it againl"feeling.2.Loser to ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters' journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel showswriting poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed atbecause of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and thatsame inspiration is not enough to win a gid or to have a happy ending. Santos'sperformance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreakingconfrontation scene: 'Friendzoned' right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella,who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She's effortless even if she is playing afrustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in rollercoaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hafing her, but I realized she'san epitome of a character we need to embracel3."100 Tula Para kay Stella" is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about afreshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to expresshis love for the campus rock star, Stella, When in college, they become close friends.When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confesshis love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that tumed into "love", but it's not atypical love story that we've seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90's FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there's the element of nostalgia in the film, resonatingwith the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of thevintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98' Degreesand Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya's "Balisong", it displays the time when Pinoy RockBands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting atthe same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the "I want to watch this!" feeling. At first, when I heard it frommy classmates. I thought it would be about 'spoken poetry' which has been in socialmedia platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino(PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6.Catharsis in NostalgiaBy Abigail Eclavea7.It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh andnew to movie audiences. 100 Tula Para kay Stella' gives the idea that mainstreamand indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardlypresent in mainstream cinema.I love that there's more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirablecharacters and the 2000's vibes.​</h2><br />

                            18. Activity 15: Speech WritingPlease refer to the Practical Task.GUIDED GENERALIZATIONIdentify what type of speech is used in the following:1.___________________________________________________________________ Did you know that during the first months of 2004, approximately 200 million birds died or were destroyed in attempt to stop the pandemic of avian influenza? Did you hear that United Nations contributor, Dr. David Navarro, estimated the number of possible human casualties as 5 – 150 million people? Are you aware that since its discovery in the 1990”s, the avian flu has been contracted by more than 100 people, and one of them died? (www.speech.guru)2._____________________________________________________________________ I will finish my speech by one of my favourite quotations. It is taken from the book written by a brilliant mathematician who dared to believe in the incredible. You must have read it in your childhood, but I want you to recall, re-evaluate and remember it. “There is no use trying, said Alice; one can’t believe impossible things. I dare say you haven’t had much practice, said the Queen. When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast” (Louis Carol).3._________________________________________________________________________ The process itself falls into four simple steps. First, ensure that the wide end of the knot is approximately 30 cm lower than the narrow end and cross the wide end over the narrow one. This will create a loop between the collar and your will-be-tie. Pass the wide end through this loop and then down. So the wide end will again be on top of the narrow one4.__________________________________________________________________________How many of you think guns are necessary to protect yourself? Would you feel the same way if you knew how often guns kill children? I don’t think so! Magazines usually tell people how beautiful and powerful guns are, and never mention how many children get hurt by guns every 0day. But I am here to ask all of you to oppose gun ownership because the fact is that guns are a weapon of violence, they take more lives away every year, and they make people blind to the fact they are killing their own children.5.___________________________________________________________________________The term OCD consists of two defining words: obsession and compulsion. As the word “disorder” speaks for itself, defining obsession and compulsion is crucial for understanding this problem. According to the Merriam-? Webster dictionary, obsession is a persistent disturbing pre-occupation with an often unreasonable idea or feeling. Compulsion, in its turn, is an irresistible, persistent impulse to perform an act-often to deal with the obsession. An OCD can be defined as a condition of the mind characterized by a constantly repeating intrusive thought, which can be neutralized only by a certain act or ritual (academichelp.net)​</h2><br />

                            19. ACTIVITY 2: WRITING THE BODY PARAGRAPH 
Resource: Handbook for Writers by Lynn Q. Troyka 
The cockroach lore that has been daunting us for years is mostly true. Roaches can live for twenty days without food, fourteen days without water; They can flatten their bodies and crawl through a crack thinner than a centavo; they can eat huge doses of carcinogens and still die of old age. They can even survive “as much radiation as an oak tree can,” says William Bell, the University of Kansas entomologist whose cockroaches appeared in the movie The Day After. They will eat almost anything--- regular food, leather, glue, hair, paper, even the starch in the bookbinding. (The New York public Library has quite a cockroach problem.) They sense the slightest breeze, and they can react and start running in .05 second; they can also remain motionless for days. And if all this isn’t creepy enough, they can fly too. 
－Jane Goldman, “What’s Bugging You?” 
 Study Guide Tip (s): 
1. There are three characteristics of an effective body paragraph: Unity, development, and coherence. 
• Unity is achieved when you have made a clear connection between the main idea of the paragraph and sentences that support the main idea. 
• Development refers to the detailed and sufficient support you give to the main idea. 
• Coherence refers to how smoothly, and logically you progress from one sentence to the next. 
2. Use the RENNS Test to check whether you are providing sufficient detail to your body paragraph. RENNS stands for Reasons, examples, names, numbers, and senses. 
Study Guide Question (s): 
1. How does the paragraph begin? 
2. What is highlighted in sentences 2 to 8? 
Output (s): 1. Identify the RENNS in the example paragraph.

First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life.

                            25. I will love you as a thief loves a gallery and as a crow loves a murder, as a cloud loves bats and as a range loves braes. I will love you as misfortune loves orphans, as fire loves innocence and as justice loves to sit and watch while everything goes wrong. I will love you as a battlefield loves young men and as peppermints love your allergies, and I will love you as the banana peel loves the shoe of a man who was just struck by a shingle falling off a house. I will love you as a volunteer fire department loves rushing into burning buildings and as burning buildings love to chase them back out, and as a parachute loves to leave a blimp and as a blimp operator loves to chase after it.I will love you as a dagger loves a certain person’s back, and as a certain person loves to wear dagger proof tunics, and as a dagger proof tunic loves to go to a certain dry cleaning facility, and how a certain employee of a dry cleaning facility loves to stay up late with a pair of binoculars, watching a dagger factory for hours in the hopes of catching a burglar, and as a burglar loves sneaking up behind people with binoculars, suddenly realizing that she has left her dagger at home. I will love you as a drawer loves a secret compartment, and as a secret compartment loves a secret, and as a secret loves to make a person gasp, and as a gasping person loves a glass of brandy to calm their nerves, and as a glass of brandy loves to shatter on the floor, and as the noise of glass shattering loves to make someone else gasp, and as someone else gasping loves a nearby desk to lean against, even if leaning against it presses a lever that loves to open a drawer and reveal a secret compartment. I will love you until all such compartments are discovered and opened, and until all the secrets have gone gasping into the world. I will love you until all the codes and hearts have been broken and until every anagram and egg has been unscrambled.I will love you until every fire is extinguised and until every home is rebuilt from the handsomest and most susceptible of woods, and until every criminal is handcuffed by the laziest of policemen. I will love until M. hates snakes and J. hates grammar, and I will love you until C. realizes S. is not worthy of his love and N. realizes he is not worthy of the V. I will love you until the bird hates a nest and the worm hates an apple, and until the apple hates a tree and the tree hates a nest, and until a bird hates a tree and an apple hates a nest, although honestly I cannot imagine that last occurrence no matter how hard I try. I will love you as we grow older, which has just happened, and has happened again, and happened several days ago, continuously, and then several years before that, and will continue to happen as the spinning hands of every clock and the flipping pages of every calendar mark the passage of time, except for the clocks that people have forgotten to wind and the calendars that people have forgotten to place in a highly visible area. I will love you as we find ourselves farther and farther from one another, where we once we were so close that we could slip the curved straw, and the long, slender spoon, between our lips and fingers respectively.I will love you until the chances of us running into one another slip from slim to zero, and until your face is fogged by distant memory, and your memory faced by distant fog, and your fog memorized by a distant face, and your distance distanced by the memorized memory of a foggy fog. I will love you no matter where you go and who you see, no matter where you avoid and who you don’t see, and no matter who sees you avoiding where you go. I will love you no matter what happens to you, and no matter how I discover what happens to you, and no matter what happens to me as I discover this, and now matter how I am discovered after what happens to me as I am discovering this.Where is this from?​</h2><br />
