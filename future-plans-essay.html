                            5. ACTIVITY 2: Create an Essay about the current Economic Situation in our Country. How does it affects our lives. How do you observe your parents to survive? And, what can you do to or contribute to make it less easier or what are your future plans to at least help. Write it in a margined long bond paper.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The current economic situation in our country is one of the biggest challenges that many people are facing. The recent economic downturn has hit the country hard, causing widespread job losses, decreased purchasing power, and an overall decline in the standard of living for many individuals and families. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these problems, leading to even more job losses, business closures, and economic instability.</p><p></p><p>The effects of the current economic situation are far-reaching and have a profound impact on our lives. For many people, the lack of job security and decreased purchasing power has led to increased stress, anxiety, and financial insecurity. This can be especially difficult for families who are trying to make ends meet and provide for their loved ones. In some cases, people have had to make difficult choices, such as cutting back on necessities such as food, healthcare, and education, in order to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>In observing my parents, I can see the stress and difficulty they face in trying to survive in this economic climate. They work hard to provide for our family, but it often feels like there is never enough money to go around. Despite this, they remain optimistic and continue to work towards a better future for our family. They have had to make sacrifices, such as cutting back on spending and taking on multiple jobs, in order to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>As a young person, I want to do my part to help make the current economic situation less difficult for those around me. One of the ways I can contribute is by being mindful of my spending and saving my money, so that I can support my family and others when they need it. In the future, I plan to continue my education and gain the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in my chosen career. This will enable me to provide for myself and my loved ones, and also help to contribute to the overall economic stability of our country.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the current economic situation in our country is a major challenge that affects us all. However, by working together, we can help to ease the burden and make life a little easier for everyone. Whether it is through making smart financial choices, supporting others, or investing in our own futures, we can all play a role in creating a brighter, more stable future for our country and our loved ones.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>College is my first step to achieve my dream. Currently I am a student in high school. I do my best to keep my grades up, because I know that they will help me into college. I dream of going to UCSD to get a bachelors degree in biology, then coming back to Stockton to attend UOP and getting a Doctorates degree in Pharmacy. By the time I get this degree, I will be around 28, so I hope that it will all be worth it.             After I have a doctorate, I plan to get a job working for a company under their research division. I hope I can lend a hand in finding new, more effective ways of administering drugs to patents. Or I could possibly design self-administration drugs for those at home type of people. Or perhaps I could improve packaging designs for the medication. The possibilities are endless!             Outside of my job, I plan to buy a large home. I dream of settling down in an urban area, someplace that's not too big. A Stockton type of town, but not Stockton. Possibly Monterey or Carmel. Hopefully by the time I get a house, I'll have a wife and can start a family. I dream of having a son to carry on the family name.             As you can see, I have big plans for my future. I plan to make something of myself, and not to give up. I have a major fear of failure, and I won't let it get to me. My parents expect a lot out of me, and I think I have done a good job so far. My dreams are what keep me going; they are an object for me to strive for. I will obtain that object one day.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>SANA MAKATULONG</p><p>PA BRAINLIEST PO</p><p>PWEDE POBA KAHIT BIOLOGY??</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes, I do. Food is one of the things that brings comfort to a person. If I were to choose for a great investment in the future, that would be a restaurant. Because not only am I helping people have their cravings or get to enjoy delicious foods, I am also being of good use to my fellow Filipino's by giving them more opportunities for them to work and provide for for their families. My plans for my restaurant would be to make it as affordable as I can, because I want to feed as many people as I can, and there is no best way to do that than have everybody afford the food that I am selling. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps!</p><br />

                        I want my future family to have similar aspects of my current family, such as loving my children as much as my mom does, along with aspects of Gil’s family, like how even when he was stressed, he still stayed and cared for his family. Even as a child, I have always thought I would be a fun mother, and I hope to have a family somewhat of the likes of Gil’s. His children had fun, and, although he was stressed out often times, he found a way to still make time for what matters most: being with his family. I know it will be a little hard to obtain this goal, but I will try my very best to make a loving family who will go out on a limb for you. I believe a family should do anything for you when you need them most and I will shape my children into people I would want to be friends with. In order for me to try to keep qualities like my family now, I would need to work with the parenting styles my parents have shown me through the years.Hope it helps!

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The life-long value and benefits of involvement in reading have been explored in a number of research projects. An understanding of the benefits of involvement in writing is however much less established. What studies do exist have often focussed on individual writers reflecting, not always accurately, on their path to publication, and studies by scholars of individual writers, with necessary concentration on the central figure being studied rather than wider trends.
</p><p>
</p><p>It was decided therefore to address this research gap by undertaking a research project on a large group of writers and to contact them by setting up a consortium of writing organisations who would be willing to share a questionnaire with their membership/client/subscriber lists.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>The causes and effects of overpopulation covers such a vast array of ideas that it is impossible for one to cover every important detail of this ever growing environmental concern. In this semi-extensive research I have only taken the opportunity to provide the basic facts that are necessary in understanding that the rapid growth of our population needs our immediate attention. In conclusion, the world’s population will continue to grow as long as birth rate exceeds death rate. As far as resources are concerned, it is apparent that the era of cheap energy, adequate amounts of food, and necessary open spaces is coming to an end. Regardless of whether we admit it or not, our attempts to stabilize population, or our failure to do so, will have a devastating affect on our lives, and our home: Mother Earth.</p><br />
