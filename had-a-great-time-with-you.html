                        <p></p><p>Answer and Explanation:
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Many groups find it difficult to establish good leadership that guides the group towards efficient and relevant paths that help them achieve their goals. Poor leadership ends up harming, and sometimes making teamwork impossible, leading group members to go through severe difficulties, many of which end up disintegrating the group. Based on this, I can say that in my opinion, the groups had difficulties due to poor leadership and insufficient teamwork.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. When I think of a good memory in relation to the activities of a group, I remember the day when I participated in a group that helped a community near mine, which had been flooded due to heavy rains. Although the group did not do good directly to me, I felt very happy to promote teamwork to help the people they needed, making them more excited and happy, despite the difficulties</p><p></p><br />
