                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>Tom Hanks.</p>Tom is said to be a deeply religious man who regularly attends church. He has previously stated that his primary motivation for attending church is to encounter the great unanswered questions that humanity has always posed.The actor is known for being a very humble, down-to-earth guy, which is most likely due to his upbringing in a religious household. Tom was exposed to various religions as a child because his parents divorced and remarried, each with their own religious beliefs. Tom identified with a variety of religions, including Mormonism, Catholicism, and Evangelicalism.When Tom married Rita Wilson in 1988, he found a home in the Greek Orthodox Church. He has stated that he enjoys being Orthodox because the environment allows him to meditate and reflect on larger life issues. This was the point at which his faith truly matured. When it comes to his personal beliefs about God, Tom believes it is a very personal matter. His beliefs are most likely influenced by how he was raised.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Even we don't value ourselves — He still values each and every living soul as worthy of being redeemed and set free from the power of sin.</p><br />

                            21. In what way does the
Sacred Scripture/Bible
help an Student
develop his/her Faith in
God?</h2><br />
                         ANSWER<p></p><p>Paul told Timothy, "All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work" (2 Tim. 3:16, CSB). The Scriptures are beneficial or useful to shape a person spiritually and lead them into greater holiness and spiritual vibrancy. Simply put, there is no spiritual growth apart from the Word</p><p></p><p>Three Ways the Bible Brings Spiritual Growth</p><p>Because the Bible is God's very Word and is "living and effective" (Heb. 4:12, CSB), it is the primary means God has chosen to reveal Himself to us and to shape our lives to know, understand, and follow Him. Engaging and studying the Bible can lead to spiritual growth in at least three ways.</p><p></p><p>The Bible reveals to us the greatness and goodness of God.</p><p></p>The first way the Bible brings spiritual growth in our lives is by telling us about God Himself. Through the pages of the Scriptures, we read about the nature and character of God. From the first verses of the Bible, we understand that God is the perfect Creator and Ruler over all things. We see through the pages of Scripture the character of God as "compassionate and gracious…slow to anger and abounding in faithful love to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, rebellion and sin" (Ex. 34:6–7, CSB). We also see His justice in condemning sin and humbling the arrogant. The Scriptures reveal to us God as the Good Shepherd, the Faithful Provider, and the Rock of Refuge for all who will trust in Him. He is demonstrated as the One who is all-powerful, all-knowing, and everywhere present.<p></p>Furthermore, the Bible reveals to us God's great plan of salvation. The Bible points us to the face of Jesus, the God-man who came to save us from sin and death through His death on the cross and glorious resurrection from the dead. Apart from the Bible, we would not have this understanding of God's nature and work through Christ and the Holy Spirit. And as we constantly look at who Christ is through the pages of Scripture, we are transformed into His likeness day by day (2 Cor. 3:18).<p></p>The Bible renews our minds to think God's thoughts.<p></p><p>  2.  The second way the Bible brings spiritual growth to our lives is by renewing our minds so that we think, understand, and approach all of life from God's perspective, instead of the prevailing notions of our cultures. When we read, study, and meditate on God's Word, we consistently find ourselves being amazed at the way God does things. He comes to the broken; He rescues the weak; He confounds the wise; He loves His enemies. He is the embodiment of biblical wisdom. Left to ourselves we might be able to manufacture some good ideas about how to live, but we will often do things contrary to God's will.</p><p></p>The Bible shows us the greatest in the Kingdom of God are the servants and humble and peacemakers, and the Holy Spirit work through God's Word to remind us of this (John 14:26). Through the Bible, we learn that our neighbor isn't just the person who lives near us, but the neighbor we are to love is the person we'd never choose to associate with. The Bible shows us that freely and generously giving away our treasure is, in fact, the way to store up treasure in heaven. The Bible teaches us that life is found not in our own strength or victory, but by laying down our lives for the sake of Christ.<p></p>This transformed thinking is key to growing spiritually, and the Bible is essential for us to be "transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God" (Rom. 12:2).<p></p>The Bible redirects our lives away from sin and towards holiness<p></p><p>  3. Finally, the Bible brings spiritual growth to our lives by showing us what is evil, sinful, and dishonoring to God. As it shows us what sin is, it also tells us what righteous living looks like. We grow spiritually as we see our sin, repent of it, and walk in holiness and righteousness through our faith in Christ and by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p><p></p>The Bible shows us a way of life that turns from sin and embraces holiness. As we see God's goodness and grace through the gospel and are renewed in our minds to think in alignment with God's thoughts, we can then act in a way that pleases Him and blesses others. This is truly spiritual growth—that we become like Jesus in all things (Rom. 8:28–29). The more we engage and study the Bible, the more we can be transformed and grow.<p></p><p></p><p>if the Bible is something more than just a fact book, then those who will engage, study, and meditate on the Bible will find themselves growing spiritually. As the research in Transformational Discipleship stated, "When believers are willing to place their lives on a collision course with God's Word, then transformation can occur." The Bible is essential to spiritual transformation.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Saint Lorenzo Ruiz and Companions' Story</p><p></p><p>Lorenzo was born in Manila of a Chinese father and a Filipino mother, both Christians. Thus he learned Chinese and Tagalog from them, and Spanish from the Dominicans whom he served as altar boy and sacristan. He became a professional calligrapher, transcribing documents in beautiful penmanship. He was a full member of the Confraternity of the Holy Rosary under Dominican auspices. He married and had two sons and a daughter.</p><p></p><p>Lorenzo's life took an abrupt turn when he was accused of murder. Nothing further is known except the statement of two Dominicans that “he was sought by the authorities on account of a homicide to which he was present or which was attributed to him.”</p><p></p><p>At that time, three Dominican priests, Antonio Gonzalez, Guillermo Courtet, and Miguel de Aozaraza, were about to sail to Japan in spite of a violent persecution there. With them was a Japanese priest, Vicente Shiwozuka de la Cruz, and a layman named Lazaro, a leper. Lorenzo, having taken asylum with them, was allowed to accompany them. But only when they were at sea did he learn that they were going to Japan.</p><p></p><p>They landed at Okinawa. Lorenzo could have gone on to Formosa, but, he reported, “I decided to stay with the Fathers, because the Spaniards would hang me there.” In Japan they were soon found out, arrested, and taken to Nagasaki. The site of wholesale bloodshed when the atomic bomb was dropped had known tragedy before. The 50,000 Catholics who once lived there were dispersed or killed by persecution.</p><p></p><p>They were subjected to an unspeakable kind of torture: After huge quantities of water were forced down their throats, they were made to lie down. Long boards were placed on their stomachs and guards then stepped on the ends of the boards, forcing the water to spurt violently from mouth, nose and ears.</p><p></p><p>The superior, Fr. Gonzalez, died after some days. Both Fr. Shiwozuka and Lazaro broke under torture, which included the insertion of bamboo needles under their fingernails. But both were brought back to courage by their companions.</p><p></p><p>In Lorenzo’s moment of crisis, he asked the interpreter, “I would like to know if, by apostatizing, they will spare my life.” The interpreter was noncommittal, but in the ensuing hours Lorenzo felt his faith grow strong. He became bold, even audacious, with his interrogators.</p><p></p><p>The five were put to death by being hanged upside down in pits. Boards fitted with semi-circular holes were fitted around their waists and stones put on top to increase the pressure. They were tightly bound, to slow circulation and prevent a speedy death. They were allowed to hang for three days. By that time Lorenzo and Lazaro were dead. Still alive, the three priests were then beheaded.</p><p></p><p>In 1987, Pope John Paul II canonized these six and 10 others: Asians and Europeans, men and women, who spread the faith in the Philippines, Formosa, and Japan. Lorenzo Ruiz is the first canonized Filipino martyr. The Liturgical Feast of Saint Lorenzo Ruiz and Companions is September 28.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hopefully it may help</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>St. Lorenzo Ruiz could be called an “unexpected” martyr. He certainly didn’t plan on sacrificing his life for the Catholic faith, but when he was given the chance, he didn’t have a moment’s hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Ruiz was a family man, married to a woman named Rosario, and father to three children. Catholic faith permeated his family and they lived a relatively ordinary life.</p><p></p><p>However, when he was falsely accused of murder, his life was turned upside down and he had to make a choice. He joined several missionaries to set out on a journey, where he waited in Japan until the charges were cleared.</p><p></p><p>This didn’t go as planned, either, as he and his companions were captured and sentenced to death by local Japanese rulers. They would set him free if only he renounced his Christian faith.</p><p></p><p>Instead of renouncing his faith so that he could live another day, Ruiz stayed rooted in his Christianity. He reportedly said the following statement before his martyrdom.</p><br />
