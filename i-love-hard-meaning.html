But out of crisis comes an outpouring of response to provide support for mental and well-being of those who are vulnerable and people in the Frontline during and after the covid-19 outbreak. it is hard to fight a battle when you cannot see the enemy. this is what makes everything so hard in this crisis we face. the lawmakers are lost with what to do. it's a hit &amp; miss situation when it comes to implementing guidelines. but there are so many people affected with the loss of jobs. the inability to earn a living, dependence in government subsidy and resources, which is so finite and scarce. so the vulnerable population has grown even more vulnerable and now, even the middle class are affected. as a humanitarian responder, I know I have to do something and I know I can do more. quarantine is not a hindrance.

Dear Jen, Forgive me if I failed to be a good mother. Forgive me if I failed to make you my princess and to stand beside you like a queen. Sorry, if I failed you. My dear Jen, I never had an education. My parents believed that I was not worthy to be sent to school, that I was better off as a housemaid. I only learned to read and to write when your Papa taught me. He was the only person in my life who supported and believed in me. Life has been so unfair to me. Every- thing does not seem to fall in proper places. Life and people were so hard on me, that is why I find it hard to trust people easily. I knew that I would come to this point, and forgive me if I could not tum my fate around. This is it Promise me, my dear Jen, that you will change the course of your fate. The road that I took was rough and hard, but that does not mean that you will take the same route. I may leave you physically, but I will always be with you in all your journeys.

2. Create a critique of the topic and evaluate whether or not the text is worth sharing
with other people.
Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</a>

I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</a>

LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

                                            ( Identify the Setiing, Conflict, Character, plot, theme, resolution.I have cried bitterly only twice in my life: once when my old girlfriend left me and once when my cat died. Mop was very special to me. Her death taught me not to delay getting proper care for loved ones.Mop came into my life as a kitten. Her mother died when she was very small, so I raised her all by myself. I took her to work every day and gave her milk every hour for two or three weeks until she was big enough to stay home. When Mop was two or three years old, I took in a stray Tom cat and Mop soon got pregnant. Mop got sick shortly after she had kittens. Her kittens all died and she got weaker and weaker. She ate and drank very little and spent most of her time lying on the floor and staring into space. I thought about taking her to the vet, but I did not want to spend all that money and I hoped that she would eventually just get well on her own. Finally, she looked so sick and unhappy that I gave in and took her to the vet. He said she was too far gone and would soon die. I took her home and watched her carefully. A day or two later, she died in my arms. As I held her thin body in my hands, I remembered all the fun we had and the times I was mean to her. I felt my heart breaking and I cried hard for ten minutes. Then I wrapped her in a plastic bag and took her to Monkey Mountain, where I buried her in an unmarked grave beside a trail.I felt bad about waiting so long to take Mop to the vet and I decided that if any of my pets or family members got sick, I would not wait to take them to the doctor. If I had acted sooner, Mop might still be alive, or at least she would not have suffered so much for so long.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>The figurative language used in the lyrics is:</p><p></p><p>Simile: "I'm in a field of dandelions, wishing on every one that you'll be mine, mine." - This is a simile because it uses the word "like" to compare being in a field of dandelions to the act of wishing on every one of them, implying that the person's desire for the other person is as abundant as the dandelions in the field.</p><p></p><p>Hyperbole: "And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime, and I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine." - This is a hyperbole because it exaggerates the rarity of finding true love by saying it only comes once in a lifetime, implying that the person believes the other person is their one true love.</p><p></p><p>Metaphor: "Dandelion, into the wind you go, won't you let my darling know?" - This is a metaphor because it compares a dandelion being blown by the wind to the act of conveying a message to the person's "darling." It implies that the person is hoping the message reaches their loved one just like a dandelion disperses its seeds through the wind.</p><p></p><p>Personification: "I see forever in your eyes" - This is personification because it gives human qualities, such as seeing forever, to the eyes of the person the lyrics are addressed to. It implies a deep emotional connection and suggests that the person's eyes hold a sense of eternity.</p><p></p><p>Hyperbole: "I've never felt so alive and free, when you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy." - This is a hyperbole because it exaggerates the intensity of the person's feelings when the other person is looking at them. It implies that their happiness and sense of freedom are greatly amplified in the presence of the other person.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Glad to help ^^ </p><p>pa brainly if you don't mind </p><p></p><br />

Every- thing does not seem to fall in proper places. Life and people were so hard on me, that is why I find it hard to trust people easily.

2. Create a critique of the topic and evaluate whether or not the text is worth sharing
with other people.
Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The topic presented is a personal opinion on the pros and cons of owning a car in the Philippines. The writer discusses the inconvenience of relying on public transportation and the benefits of owning a car. They acknowledge the financial burden that comes with owning a car but believe that the additional expense is worth the benefits it provides.</p><p></p><p>While the writer's personal experience and perspective are valid, the article could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the issue. For instance, the article does not consider the environmental impact of owning a car, which is a significant concern in the modern world. Additionally, the writer does not consider alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or motorcycles, which could provide similar benefits at a lower cost.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the article lacks statistical evidence or research to back up the claims made, which would have added credibility to the author's opinion. The writer could have provided additional sources and data to support their argument and provide a more well-rounded view of the topic.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the article provides a personal opinion on owning a car in the Philippines, but it lacks a thorough analysis of the issue. It could benefit from more research and evidence to support the author's perspective. However, the topic is still worth sharing with others as it can initiate a conversation on the pros and cons of owning a car and encourage people to consider alternative modes of transportation.</p><br />

                            21. how messed up is this?!
 my mom turned off my phone number for 6 months unless I can get my grades up. (i have mostly d's and a couple of f's and one c...) and now my dad can't call me or use the tracker. no number means no tracker. and I have a hard time sleeping as it is. I wake up late a lot of the time but before I would have people call me in the mornings to wake me up. I have 2 alarms that go off. and yesterday I decided to use my third one. I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</h2><br />

LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

                            29. ( Identify the Setiing, Conflict, Character, plot, theme, resolution.I have cried bitterly only twice in my life: once when my old girlfriend left me and once when my cat died. Mop was very special to me. Her death taught me not to delay getting proper care for loved ones.Mop came into my life as a kitten. Her mother died when she was very small, so I raised her all by myself. I took her to work every day and gave her milk every hour for two or three weeks until she was big enough to stay home. When Mop was two or three years old, I took in a stray Tom cat and Mop soon got pregnant. Mop got sick shortly after she had kittens. Her kittens all died and she got weaker and weaker. She ate and drank very little and spent most of her time lying on the floor and staring into space. I thought about taking her to the vet, but I did not want to spend all that money and I hoped that she would eventually just get well on her own. Finally, she looked so sick and unhappy that I gave in and took her to the vet. He said she was too far gone and would soon die. I took her home and watched her carefully. A day or two later, she died in my arms. As I held her thin body in my hands, I remembered all the fun we had and the times I was mean to her. I felt my heart breaking and I cried hard for ten minutes. Then I wrapped her in a plastic bag and took her to Monkey Mountain, where I buried her in an unmarked grave beside a trail.I felt bad about waiting so long to take Mop to the vet and I decided that if any of my pets or family members got sick, I would not wait to take them to the doctor. If I had acted sooner, Mop might still be alive, or at least she would not have suffered so much for so long.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Skip to main content</p><p></p><p>￼</p><p></p><p>English 111</p><p></p><p>Unit 4: Types of Writing</p><p></p><p>Narrative Essays</p><p></p><p>What is Narrative Writing?</p><p></p><p>When you write a book report or tell a story or explain what happened first, second, and third you are giving a narrative account. Narrative writing is commonly used when we want to share our ideas with others. We write about what we like, what’s important to us, and what we think others will enjoy reading. Narrative writing is descriptive writing, but it is not usually associated with academic writing that requires higher-order thinking skills, including the research components described in Bloom’s taxonomy (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation).</p><p>Narrative writing is often associated with fiction writing. We write about people who do things. We write about a struggle and how it is overcome. We usually write from a particular perspective or point of view: “Let me tell you about my first day in public school. It still stands out as one of the worst days of my life…..” or “Going to first grade for me was so exciting! I could hardly wait to get there, and when I look back at that wonderful day with a beautiful teacher and all those new people I’d never seen before, I still get a thrill.”</p><p>You can see from the two above examples that narratives are often written in first person. Readers are encouraged to be a part of the author’s world. They’re invited into that world by the author’s words and images and details. Narrative writing involves vivid, descriptive examples of people and events.</p><p>If you think of narrative writing as storytelling, you can begin a short narrative project. Consider the essential elements of a story: it must have a setting, it must contain characters, there must be a particular plot or story line, a problem (sometimes called ‘conflict’) must come into play to help move the story along, there must eventually be a resolution to the problem, and the story must be told from someone’s perspective (or point of view). We’ll look at each of these elements of narrative writing:</p><p></p><p>Setting</p><p></p><p>Characters</p><p></p><p>Plot</p><p></p><p>Problem and Resolution</p><p></p><p>Perspective, often called Point of View</p><p></p><p>Setting</p><p></p><p>￼“It was a dark and stormy night.” There’s a setting for you. Charlie Brown’s dog, Snoopy, began his great American novel with that opening line. It sent chills down every child’s spine just thinking about Snoopy looking out drearily from within the shelter of his dog house!</p><p>A setting must be somewhere. The story you are telling must take place in some specific place at some specific time, whether it’s in a space ship on its way to another galaxy or the attic in your house. It can certainly be an imaginary place, but even imaginary places have to be described. Your reader must have a sense of place. If you’re writing about a log cabin in the woods, is it a vacation cabin that your family rents each summer, with all the modern conveniences (including WiFi), or is it a pioneer family’s crudely-constructed hut quickly built from scavenged logs in the Wyoming wilderness of 1820? The characters and story that you develop are clearly dependent on the setting you develop for the reader.</p><p></p><p>Characters</p><p></p><p>Your setting needs to have characters that do things connected to the place you’ve put them in. If you’re writing about dogs and cats, you don’t necessarily need people. In that case, the dogs and cats are your characters. If you do have people, they’ll be interacting with each other in some way. Dogs, cats, and people (and any characters you create) will have names and personalities and they will speak to each other and deal with all the situations in your story.</p><p>You may be very creative with your characters, assigning very particular characteristics to each. You need main characters and supporting characters. Your narrative will be about a person or two or three people who interact within the plot of your narrative. Characters can be heroic “protagonists” and their arch enemies, the “antagonists,” who are out to get them. Characters are needed to move the story through the events needed to get from the beginning to the end.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            30. Identify which principle is asked in each example. Write PI if it is Principle of Identity; PNC if it is Principle of Non-Contradiction; and PEM if it is Principle of Excluded Middle. If Helium is a noble gas; and noble gases are elements; therefore, Helium is an element.” *1. If Helium is a noble gas; and noble gases are elements; therefore, Helium is an element2. Life is the flower for which love is the honey. *3. The purpose of our life is to be happy4. You said fast food is bad for you, yet I saw you eating burger yesterday5. Ostrich can fly6. If my absence doesn’t affect your life, then my presence has no meaning to it7. Life is really simple, but people insist on making it complicated.” 8. Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you’re gonna get.9. Only true love can fuel the hard work that awaits you.” *10. You said you love me, then why did you leave me? *11. “Less talk , more mistakes.” *12. “In three words I can sum up everything I’ve learned about life: It goes on.” ​</h2><br />
