                                            ACTIVITY 1
Below are examples of comparison and contrast type of texts. Tell what is 
being compared/contrasted in each paragraph.
1. Both reading books at home and going on vacation are fun. Through reading, 
you meet new people and see new places at less expense. When you don’t feel 
like interacting with new friends you just stop reading.
 Going on vacation gives you opportunity to meet new people in the flesh and 
see new places with your eyes but you must spend much for your fare, your food, 
and the entrance tickets to the tourist spots. Besides, when your newfound friends 
become bothersome, you cannot get away from them easily. 
2. I haven’t been to Bali, Indonesia but I have read about it. I have been to 
 Boracay that is why I know these two awesome tourist destinations are similar in 
many ways. Both are small islands that have five beaches, hillside terraces and 
cool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisines because people 
from all over the world visit them. However, Bali’s beaches are golden while those 
of Boracay are white and the sand is fine as powder. A village in Bali is famous for 
its gold and silver work. There is none of this in Boracay. There is a cultural center 
in Bali called Ubud. On the other hand, there are only shops where you can buy 
goods that are very Filipino in Boracay.
3. I never thought I would be homesick for my old school, but during my first week 
at my new school, I kept thinking how happy I had been there and how uneasy I 
was here. The trouble was, I didn’t know anybody yet. At my new school, I felt at 
first that the teachers did not have time for me. Everyone seemed busy. Then I 
remembered the time when I first started going to my old school. I had felt the 
same way- a little lost and lonely- but after a while, I made friends. The strangeness 
wore off. Remembering that made me feel there was hope for my new school after 
all.

Following all the protocols, such as, always washing your hands, always wearing a mask, social distancing, avoiding touching your face, etc. Its incredible and frightening how fast everything changes, as well as how fast time flies fast. And yet, in the middle of the health pandemic, we are learning many powerful lessons. Recognizing how important the smallest of things are to us a haircut, hanging out with friends at a restaurant, school and games, we vow never to take anything for granted again. I keep thinking it’s a bad movie playing in my dream. A bad movie that you cannot turn off, it just keeps causing devastation. In short, I learned to appreciate the life I once had.Thanks &lt;3​</a>

                                            Putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
Never put my love out on the line
Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care, I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair, then make 'em bounce like a basketball
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair; pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air; it feels so good, but you know it hurts
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
The feelings got lost in my lungs
They're burning; I'd rather be numb (rather be numb)
And there's no one else to blame (no one else to blame)
So scared, I take off, and I run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I burst into fla-fla-flames
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack (heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack-tack
I think I'd have a heart attack (oh, I think I'd have a heart attack)

Did you have enough money to pay your electric bills before the cut-off date? How are you affected by these situations? In this module, you will know that there are different stages of stress that you experience in your everyday life. It is important to remember that stress is not a definition of 'one size fits all'. Depending on the way you view the stressor, what stresses one person out might not bother you at all. This is why the causes and consequences of stress are important to consider, as well as how to recognize your own stressors and how to handle your stress properly. Stress is defined as a physiological and emotional responses to significant or unexpected change one's life (Payne, et al., 2005). It may also refer to what you feel when you react to pressure from the outside world or from yourself. Activity 3. Remember Me! There are two kinds of stress: eustress and distress. Eustress refers to positive and healthy response of the body from the stressor On the other hand, distress refers to a negative reaction of the body towards a given stressor. Directions: Identify the following situations as to eustress and distress, Draw if it is eustress and if distress, 1. Going to the beach 2. Getting a low grade 3. Arguing with your friend 4. Attending a birthday party 5. Watching your favorite movie 6. Losing your money 7. Having a new shoe 8. You passed your periodical exam 9. You are left by the school bus 10. Your favorite toy was broken​</a>

                            4. ACTIVITY 1
Below are examples of comparison and contrast type of texts. Tell what is 
being compared/contrasted in each paragraph.
1. Both reading books at home and going on vacation are fun. Through reading, 
you meet new people and see new places at less expense. When you don’t feel 
like interacting with new friends you just stop reading.
 Going on vacation gives you opportunity to meet new people in the flesh and 
see new places with your eyes but you must spend much for your fare, your food, 
and the entrance tickets to the tourist spots. Besides, when your newfound friends 
become bothersome, you cannot get away from them easily. 
2. I haven’t been to Bali, Indonesia but I have read about it. I have been to 
 Boracay that is why I know these two awesome tourist destinations are similar in 
many ways. Both are small islands that have five beaches, hillside terraces and 
cool green hills. Bali and Boracay boast of international cuisines because people 
from all over the world visit them. However, Bali’s beaches are golden while those 
of Boracay are white and the sand is fine as powder. A village in Bali is famous for 
its gold and silver work. There is none of this in Boracay. There is a cultural center 
in Bali called Ubud. On the other hand, there are only shops where you can buy 
goods that are very Filipino in Boracay.
3. I never thought I would be homesick for my old school, but during my first week 
at my new school, I kept thinking how happy I had been there and how uneasy I 
was here. The trouble was, I didn’t know anybody yet. At my new school, I felt at 
first that the teachers did not have time for me. Everyone seemed busy. Then I 
remembered the time when I first started going to my old school. I had felt the 
same way- a little lost and lonely- but after a while, I made friends. The strangeness 
wore off. Remembering that made me feel there was hope for my new school after 
all.

Following all the protocols, such as, always washing your hands, always wearing a mask, social distancing, avoiding touching your face, etc. Its incredible and frightening how fast everything changes, as well as how fast time flies fast. And yet, in the middle of the health pandemic, we are learning many powerful lessons. Recognizing how important the smallest of things are to us a haircut, hanging out with friends at a restaurant, school and games, we vow never to take anything for granted again. I keep thinking it’s a bad movie playing in my dream. A bad movie that you cannot turn off, it just keeps causing devastation. In short, I learned to appreciate the life I once had.Thanks &lt;3​</h2><br />

                            27. Putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
Never put my love out on the line
Never said yes to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care, I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair, then make 'em bounce like a basketball
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair; pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air; it feels so good, but you know it hurts
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
The feelings got lost in my lungs
They're burning; I'd rather be numb (rather be numb)
And there's no one else to blame (no one else to blame)
So scared, I take off, and I run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I burst into fla-fla-flames
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack (heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack-tack
I think I'd have a heart attack (oh, I think I'd have a heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack</h2><br />

It may also refer to what you feel when you react to pressure from the outside world or from yourself. Activity 3. Remember Me! There are two kinds of stress: eustress and distress. Eustress refers to positive and healthy response of the body from the stressor On the other hand, distress refers to a negative reaction of the body towards a given stressor.
