FATHER’S DAY MESSAGE
First of all, I would like to address that not every father is perfect. Every human makes a mistake at least once in his or her life. And these include both of our parents, especially our fathers.
Our fathers are considered as the head of the family, and for understandable reasons, they are responsible for taking care for the family as a whole. While a mother may be the light, the father will be the leader.
But we take the role of our fathers for granted, with modern times rushing in, the role of fathers seem to be less prominent than it ever was before.  With single mothers increasing every day and most fathers disappearing.
But for the fathers that stuck around, I would like to thank yous. Thank you for facing your problems, thank you for staying with us even though you knew for a fact that being a father come with great responsibility.
More specifically, I would like to thank my dad for staying with us for this long. Dealing with our problems and incompetency with such patience, and even though there were some moments where things go wrong, you still stood d up by our side.
And for the fathers that didn’t
I honestly can’t blame you</a>

                                            The Thirsty CrowOne hot day, a thirsty crow name Tintin flew all over the fields looking for water.For a long time, she could not find any. She felt very weak, almost giving up hope.Suddenly, she saw a water jug below her. She flew straight down to see if therewas any water inside. Yes, she could see some water inside the jug!The crow tried to push her head into the jug. Sadly, she found that the neck ofthe jug was too narrow. Then she tried to push the jug down for the water to flow out.She found that the jug was too heavy.The crow thought hard for a while. Then looking around her, she saw somepebbles. She suddenly had a good idea. She started picking up the pebbles one byone, dropping each into the jug. As more and more pebbles filled the jug, the waterlevel kept rising. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. Her plan had worked!Upon reading the story what do you feel about Tintin the crow? Do you think she issmart? Why?Sana po masagot,Thank you in Advance!​</a>

FATHER’S DAY MESSAGE
First of all, I would like to address that not every father is perfect. Every human makes a mistake at least once in his or her life. And these include both of our parents, especially our fathers.
Our fathers are considered as the head of the family, and for understandable reasons, they are responsible for taking care for the family as a whole. While a mother may be the light, the father will be the leader.
But we take the role of our fathers for granted, with modern times rushing in, the role of fathers seem to be less prominent than it ever was before.  With single mothers increasing every day and most fathers disappearing.
But for the fathers that stuck around, I would like to thank yous. Thank you for facing your problems, thank you for staying with us even though you knew for a fact that being a father come with great responsibility.
More specifically, I would like to thank my dad for staying with us for this long. Dealing with our problems and incompetency with such patience, and even though there were some moments where things go wrong, you still stood d up by our side.
And for the fathers that didn’t
I honestly can’t blame you</h2><br />

                            12. The Thirsty CrowOne hot day, a thirsty crow name Tintin flew all over the fields looking for water.For a long time, she could not find any. She felt very weak, almost giving up hope.Suddenly, she saw a water jug below her. She flew straight down to see if therewas any water inside. Yes, she could see some water inside the jug!The crow tried to push her head into the jug. Sadly, she found that the neck ofthe jug was too narrow. Then she tried to push the jug down for the water to flow out.She found that the jug was too heavy.The crow thought hard for a while. Then looking around her, she saw somepebbles. She suddenly had a good idea. She started picking up the pebbles one byone, dropping each into the jug. As more and more pebbles filled the jug, the waterlevel kept rising. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. Her plan had worked!Upon reading the story what do you feel about Tintin the crow? Do you think she issmart? Why?Sana po masagot,Thank you in Advance!​</h2><br />
