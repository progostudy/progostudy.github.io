                                            My brother and sister were both a great help during my homeschooling. My brother is a Math wizard. He made me understood the concepts presented under the “What Is It” part of my Math module. He prepared many examples for me to learn better. However, he was strict and hot-tempered. He easily got irritated every time I forgot the quadratic equation formula and scolded me right away when I committed mistakes in solving problems. He did not listen to my reasons for according to him all boys should be clever in Math and that my excuses were not acceptable. My sister, on the other hand, was good in English. She explained the readings in my English module excellently, which made me learn to love the subject. Moreover, she was so sympathetic when I committed mistakes in answering the exercises and guided me in recognizing and correcting them as well. I think most sisters are like her.

                                            Annabel LeeBY EDGAR ALLAN POEIt was many and many a year ago,In a kingdom by the sea,That a maiden there lived whom you may knowBy the name of Annabel Lee;And this maiden she lived with no other thoughtThan to love and be loved by me.I was a child and she was a child,In this kingdom by the sea,But we loved with a love that was more than love—I and my Annabel Lee—With a love that the wingèd seraphs of HeavenCoveted her and me.And this was the reason that, long ago,In this kingdom by the sea,A wind blew out of a cloud, chillingNor the demons down under the seaCan ever dissever my soul from the soulOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreamsOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;My beautiful Annabel Lee;So that her highborn kinsmen cameAnd bore her away from me,To shut her up in a sepulchreIn this kingdom by the sea.The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,Went envying her and me—Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,In this kingdom by the sea)That the wind came out of the cloud by night,Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.But our love it was stronger by far than the loveOf those who were older than we—Of many far wiser than we—And neither the angels in Heaven aboveAnd the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyesOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the sideOf my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,In her sepulchre there by the sea—In her tomb by the sounding sea.1.

-THE FREE BIRD AND THE CAGE BIRD 
The tame bird was in a cage; the free bird was in the forest.
They met when the time came, it was a decree of fate.
The free bird cries, 'O my love, let us fly to the wood.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Come hither, let us both live in the cage.'
Says the free bird, 'Among bars, where is there room to spread one's wings?'
'Alas,' cries the caged bird, 'I should not know where to sit perched in the sky.'
The free bird cries, 'My darling, sing the songs of the woodlands.'
The cage bird sings, 'Sit by my side, I'll teach you the speech of the learned.'
The forest bird cries, 'No, ah no! songs can never be taught.'
The cage bird says, 'Alas for me, I know not the songs of the woodlands.'
There love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing to wing.
Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to know each
other.
They flutter their wings in yearning, and sing, 'Come closer, my love!'
The free bird cries, 'It cannot be, I fear the closed doors of the cage.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Alas, my wings are powerless and dead.</a>

                                            The Tame Bird and the Free Bird The tame bird was in a cage; the free bird was in the forest, They met when the time came; it was a decree of fate, The free bird cried, "Oh my love let us fly to the worlds," The caged bird whispered, "Come here! Let us both live in the cage," Said the free birds, "Among bars, where is the room to spread one's wings?" "Alas", said the cage bird, "I should not know where to sit, perched in the sky" The free bird cried, "My darling, sing the song of the woodlands." The cage bird said, "Sit by my side; I'll teach you the speech of the learned" The free bird cried, "No oh no! Songs can never be taught!" The cage bird said, "Alas for me!" I know not the songs of the woodlands!" Their love was intense with longing, but they never could fly wing to wing, Through the bars, of the cage they looked and vain was their wish to know each other, They fluttered their wings in yearning and sang, "Come Closer My Love!" The free bird cried, "It cannot be, I feel the closed doors of the cage!" The caged bird whispered, "Alas, my wings are powerless and dead!"​</a>

He made me understood the concepts presented under the “What Is It” part of my Math module. He prepared many examples for me to learn better. However, he was strict and hot-tempered. He easily got irritated every time I forgot the quadratic equation formula and scolded me right away when I committed mistakes in solving problems. He did not listen to my reasons for according to him all boys should be clever in Math and that my excuses were not acceptable. My sister, on the other hand, was good in English. She explained the readings in my English module excellently, which made me learn to love the subject. Moreover, she was so sympathetic when I committed mistakes in answering the exercises and guided me in recognizing and correcting them as well. I think most sisters are like her.

                            7. Annabel LeeBY EDGAR ALLAN POEIt was many and many a year ago,In a kingdom by the sea,That a maiden there lived whom you may knowBy the name of Annabel Lee;And this maiden she lived with no other thoughtThan to love and be loved by me.I was a child and she was a child,In this kingdom by the sea,But we loved with a love that was more than love—I and my Annabel Lee—With a love that the wingèd seraphs of HeavenCoveted her and me.And this was the reason that, long ago,In this kingdom by the sea,A wind blew out of a cloud, chillingNor the demons down under the seaCan ever dissever my soul from the soulOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreamsOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;My beautiful Annabel Lee;So that her highborn kinsmen cameAnd bore her away from me,To shut her up in a sepulchreIn this kingdom by the sea.The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,Went envying her and me—Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,In this kingdom by the sea)That the wind came out of the cloud by night,Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.But our love it was stronger by far than the loveOf those who were older than we—Of many far wiser than we—And neither the angels in Heaven aboveAnd the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyesOf the beautiful Annabel Lee;And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the sideOf my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,In her sepulchre there by the sea—In her tomb by the sounding sea.1.

-THE FREE BIRD AND THE CAGE BIRD 
The tame bird was in a cage; the free bird was in the forest.
They met when the time came, it was a decree of fate.
The free bird cries, 'O my love, let us fly to the wood.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Come hither, let us both live in the cage.'
Says the free bird, 'Among bars, where is there room to spread one's wings?'
'Alas,' cries the caged bird, 'I should not know where to sit perched in the sky.'
The free bird cries, 'My darling, sing the songs of the woodlands.'
The cage bird sings, 'Sit by my side, I'll teach you the speech of the learned.'
The forest bird cries, 'No, ah no! songs can never be taught.'
The cage bird says, 'Alas for me, I know not the songs of the woodlands.'
There love is intense with longing, but they never can fly wing to wing.
Through the bars of the cage they look, and vain is their wish to know each
other.
They flutter their wings in yearning, and sing, 'Come closer, my love!'
The free bird cries, 'It cannot be, I fear the closed doors of the cage.'
The cage bird whispers, 'Alas, my wings are powerless and dead.</h2><br />

                            24. The Tame Bird and the Free Bird The tame bird was in a cage; the free bird was in the forest, They met when the time came; it was a decree of fate, The free bird cried, "Oh my love let us fly to the worlds," The caged bird whispered, "Come here! Let us both live in the cage," Said the free birds, "Among bars, where is the room to spread one's wings?" "Alas", said the cage bird, "I should not know where to sit, perched in the sky" The free bird cried, "My darling, sing the song of the woodlands." The cage bird said, "Sit by my side; I'll teach you the speech of the learned" The free bird cried, "No oh no! Songs can never be taught!" The cage bird said, "Alas for me!" I know not the songs of the woodlands!" Their love was intense with longing, but they never could fly wing to wing, Through the bars, of the cage they looked and vain was their wish to know each other, They fluttered their wings in yearning and sang, "Come Closer My Love!" The free bird cried, "It cannot be, I feel the closed doors of the cage!" The caged bird whispered, "Alas, my wings are powerless and dead!"​</h2><br />
