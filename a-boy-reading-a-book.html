The final ration would then be 28 people:8 houses (you can check that this is correct by simplifying it to see if it matches the original ratio for example 28 divided by 4 = 7 and 8 divided by 4 is 2, so this should be correct)</p><p></p><p>2.)</p><p>5 people: 1 car, 30 people: x cars</p><p>So this is similar to number 1. You find the proportion between the two ratios by dividing 30 people by 5 people to get 6. Then, multiply 6 by 1 to find the number of cards for 30 people which is 6. </p><p></p><p>3.)</p><p>3 boys: 4 girls, 12 boys: x girls</p><p>Once again, same method. 12 divided by 3 is 4, and 4 x the 4 girls is 16. So we have 16 girls.</p><p></p><p>4.) 15 books: 1 reading book, x books: 10 reading books.</p><p>10 divided by 1 is 10, multiplied by 15 to get 150. </p><p></p><p>5.)</p><p>I can't form a ratio here because the problem doesn't give how many people the two doctors can treat in one day.</p><p></p><br />
