                    <p>not see that I straddle two cultures, nor that I feel displaced in the only country I know. I identify with Americans, but Americans do not identify with me. I&#039;ve never known what it&#039;s like to belong to a community - neither one at large, nor of an extended family. I know more about Europe than the continent my ancestors unmistakably come from. I sometimes wonder, as I did that day in the dry cleaner&#039;s, if I would be a happier person bad my parents stayed in Korea. I first began to consider this thought around the time I decided to go to graduate school. It had been a compromise: my parents wanted me to go to law school; I wanted to skip the starched- collar track and be a writer - the hungrier the better. But after 20-some years of following their wishes and meeting all of their expectations, I couldn&#039;t bring myself to disobey or disappoint. A writing career is riskier than law, I remember thinking. If I&#039;m a failure and my life is a washout, then what does that make my parents&#039; lives? I know that many of my friends had to choose between pleasing their parents and being true to themselves. But for the children of immigrants, the choice seems more complicated, a happy outcome impossible. By making the biggest move of their lives for me, my parents indentured me to the largest debt imaginable - I owe them the fulfillment of their hopes for me. It tore me up inside to suppress my dream, but I went to school for a Ph.D. in English literature, thinking I had found the perfect compromise. I would be able to write at least about books while pursuing a graduate degree. Predictably, it didn&#039;t work out. How could I labor for five years in a program I had no passion for? When I finally left school, my parents were disappointed, but since it wasn&#039;t what they wanted me to do, they weren&#039;t devastated. I, on the other hand, felt I was staring at the bottom of the abyss. I had seen the flaw in my life of halfwayness, in my planned life of compromises. I hadn&#039;t thought about my love life, but I had a vague plan to make concessions there, too. Though they raised me as an American, my parents expect me to marry someone Korean and give them grandchildren who look like them. This didn&#039;t seem like such a huge request when I was 14, but now I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m going to do. I&#039;ve never been in love with someone I dated, or dated someone I loved. (Since I can&#039;t bring myself even to entertain the thought of marrying the non-Korean men I&#039;m attracted to, I&#039;ve been dating only those I know I can stay clearheaded about.) And as I near that age when the question of marriage stalks every relationship, I can&#039;t help but wonder if my parents&#039; expectations are responsible for the lack of passion in my life. My parents didn&#039;t want their daughter to be Korean, but they don&#039;t want her fully American, either. Children of immigrants are living paradoxes. We are the first generation and the last. We are in this country for its opportunities, yet filial duty binds us. When my parents boarded the plane, they knew they were embarking on a rough trip. I don&#039;t think they imagined the rocks in the path of their daughter who can&#039;t even pronounce her own name.​</p>

                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

One studenteven called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at thebeginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then,I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushesstudents and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to beproud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember havingnightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, andhold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a closecontact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gaveme faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care ofme with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day.'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes. My mom isthe dearest person and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.Answer the following questions. 1.what did the writer compare her mother with?2.write at least three sentences that described the mother based on the essay.3.Based on the given example,what is descriptive essay?

                                            "Josefina"(By May Shynne J. Torralba)Josefina was different from the rest of the girls in the class. She was with theboys most of the time and she liked to play with things that are usually played byboys. Everyone knew that she was an orphan. She was only ten years old when sheleft home to forget the heartaches brought by the tragic death of her parents. Shethought that it was best to leave home and go on with her life under the roof andguidance of her auntie and uncle.In school, she never showed weakness. Her classmates liked her because shewas courageous and agile. She was not afraid to fight with boys. Her curly hair wasalways tied up to show her neatly shaved undercut. Though she was a bit different,her classmates gave the same mutual respect towards her. This made Josefinaexpressed herself freely- from the way she dressed up to the way she carried herself.Nobody dare or care talked about her personal feeling. Not until one morning...Marcelina, her classmate, saw Josefina ran outside the gate of the school. Outof curiosity, she followed her. She called for her but Josefina kept on running untilshe was hidden behind the big tamarind tree. She saw Josefina wailing while herright hand was bleeding for punching the trunk of the tree. Reluctantly, Marcelinashowed herself to her with sympathetic look. Without a single word, Marcelina tookher hand and wiped it until it was clean. Upon hearing the silence, Marcelina tookthe opportunity to ask her classmate. "What happened?" she sighed before shebrought the words out of her mouth. Josefina looked at her and responded clearly."I am scared. I overheard that my auntie and uncle are giving me away because theycould not afford the provision needed to raise me. I don't want to but I was left withno choice. I don't know how other people would treat and accept me. They mightonly laughed and mocked at me because I am different." Marcelina felt herclassmate's honest confession. Then, she comforted her. "You think so much ofthings that has not yet happened. Is it really a sarcastic mouth that scares you orthat small voice inside you? You just need to be you... that is all.

This has been my signature line every time I wasasked if I wanted to be like my mother I did not like to be a teacher because eversince I was a kid, I already admired the broadcasting profession. In fact, I dreamed ofbecoming a news anchor - someone that could be seen on the television worldwide.Someone like Korina Sanchez to be exact. Perhaps, this could be attributed to myearly exposure to public speaking since I was used to holding a microphone during myalementary days. I was exposed in host ng simple programs at school and was givenopportunities in participating various oral contests.But everything changed when I was in high school. I came to realize that Iwanted to become an accountant. Yes, I was amazed with the thought of working in abank. I would love to work in a cozy environment and fully airconditioned room and tovear stunning uniform For four years, I had been the desire of my heart. Not until Iwas about to enroll in college.To my surprise, I changed my course in just a snap of a finger. Why? Simplybecause computer related courses were the most in demand during that time. Withouta second thought, I chose BS Computer Science instead of BS Accountancy. I soothedimyself with the end in mind of working at least in an office after graduationTime flew fast, I finally graduated from college. After graduation, I startedlooking for a job. And every time I saw my mother, who was a high school teacher,kept on telling myself that I was very fortunate for I was not a teacher. Still, I did notwant to be like her. Until one day, after several months of job hunting, I was finallyhired! To my biggest surprise, I was employed as a high school computer TEACHER.never imagined teaching for I know how difficult it was but now, I realized howmuch joy teaching has given me. For a mother like me, I see teaching similar toparenting Raising a learner is like raising your own child. Truly, to teach is to touchives Like Henry Adams, I believe that a teacher affects eternity, and no one knowswhere his/her influence stops. Indeed, it is from NEVER to FOREVER ​</a>

"I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubledwith fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places.

                            1. not see that I straddle two cultures, nor that I feel displaced in the only country I know. I identify with Americans, but Americans do not identify with me. I've never known what it's like to belong to a community - neither one at large, nor of an extended family. I know more about Europe than the continent my ancestors unmistakably come from. I sometimes wonder, as I did that day in the dry cleaner's, if I would be a happier person bad my parents stayed in Korea. I first began to consider this thought around the time I decided to go to graduate school. It had been a compromise: my parents wanted me to go to law school; I wanted to skip the starched- collar track and be a writer - the hungrier the better. But after 20-some years of following their wishes and meeting all of their expectations, I couldn't bring myself to disobey or disappoint. A writing career is riskier than law, I remember thinking. If I'm a failure and my life is a washout, then what does that make my parents' lives? I know that many of my friends had to choose between pleasing their parents and being true to themselves. But for the children of immigrants, the choice seems more complicated, a happy outcome impossible. By making the biggest move of their lives for me, my parents indentured me to the largest debt imaginable - I owe them the fulfillment of their hopes for me. It tore me up inside to suppress my dream, but I went to school for a Ph.D. in English literature, thinking I had found the perfect compromise. I would be able to write at least about books while pursuing a graduate degree. Predictably, it didn't work out. How could I labor for five years in a program I had no passion for? When I finally left school, my parents were disappointed, but since it wasn't what they wanted me to do, they weren't devastated. I, on the other hand, felt I was staring at the bottom of the abyss. I had seen the flaw in my life of halfwayness, in my planned life of compromises. I hadn't thought about my love life, but I had a vague plan to make concessions there, too. Though they raised me as an American, my parents expect me to marry someone Korean and give them grandchildren who look like them. This didn't seem like such a huge request when I was 14, but now I don't know what I'm going to do. I've never been in love with someone I dated, or dated someone I loved. (Since I can't bring myself even to entertain the thought of marrying the non-Korean men I'm attracted to, I've been dating only those I know I can stay clearheaded about.) And as I near that age when the question of marriage stalks every relationship, I can't help but wonder if my parents' expectations are responsible for the lack of passion in my life. My parents didn't want their daughter to be Korean, but they don't want her fully American, either. Children of immigrants are living paradoxes. We are the first generation and the last. We are in this country for its opportunities, yet filial duty binds us. When my parents boarded the plane, they knew they were embarking on a rough trip. I don't think they imagined the rocks in the path of their daughter who can't even pronounce her own name.​</h2><br />

                            3. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                            5. Read the example of a descriptive essay below.My Mother, My Strength!My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with asweet fragrance. I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, thefeeling I have for my mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. Sheteaches me all that she knows in what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raisingme up to be a mature, sensible and strong-minded girl.She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I wasyoung because she is more of a caretaker for those so-called bad students rather than aprofessional English teacher. However, she changed my mind with her great passion for herteaching career. Students in her school usually skip classes, spend long period of time in theInternet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I cannot imagine how my mom dealswith them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of around 40 students like this.Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her Mother Fan, which Ienvy.They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One studenteven called my mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at thebeginning because those students are known to have poor teacher-student relationships. Then,I asked one of them. She told me that my mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushesstudents and she always give them useful life suggestions. It was then that I started to beproud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember havingnightmares at a very young age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, andhold me tight until I sleep safe and sound again. When I was a schoolgirl, she kept a closecontact with my teachers. When I had troubles with studies, she never blamed me but gaveme faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful cook. She takes care ofme with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day.'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world, just as the old song goes. My mom isthe dearest person and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.Answer the following questions. 1.what did the writer compare her mother with?2.write at least three sentences that described the mother based on the essay.3.Based on the given example,what is descriptive essay?

                            15. "Josefina"(By May Shynne J. Torralba)Josefina was different from the rest of the girls in the class. She was with theboys most of the time and she liked to play with things that are usually played byboys. Everyone knew that she was an orphan. She was only ten years old when sheleft home to forget the heartaches brought by the tragic death of her parents. Shethought that it was best to leave home and go on with her life under the roof andguidance of her auntie and uncle.In school, she never showed weakness. Her classmates liked her because shewas courageous and agile. She was not afraid to fight with boys. Her curly hair wasalways tied up to show her neatly shaved undercut. Though she was a bit different,her classmates gave the same mutual respect towards her. This made Josefinaexpressed herself freely- from the way she dressed up to the way she carried herself.Nobody dare or care talked about her personal feeling. Not until one morning...Marcelina, her classmate, saw Josefina ran outside the gate of the school. Outof curiosity, she followed her. She called for her but Josefina kept on running untilshe was hidden behind the big tamarind tree. She saw Josefina wailing while herright hand was bleeding for punching the trunk of the tree. Reluctantly, Marcelinashowed herself to her with sympathetic look. Without a single word, Marcelina tookher hand and wiped it until it was clean.

This has been my signature line every time I wasasked if I wanted to be like my mother I did not like to be a teacher because eversince I was a kid, I already admired the broadcasting profession. In fact, I dreamed ofbecoming a news anchor - someone that could be seen on the television worldwide.Someone like Korina Sanchez to be exact. Perhaps, this could be attributed to myearly exposure to public speaking since I was used to holding a microphone during myalementary days. I was exposed in host ng simple programs at school and was givenopportunities in participating various oral contests.But everything changed when I was in high school. I came to realize that Iwanted to become an accountant. Yes, I was amazed with the thought of working in abank. I would love to work in a cozy environment and fully airconditioned room and tovear stunning uniform For four years, I had been the desire of my heart. Not until Iwas about to enroll in college.To my surprise, I changed my course in just a snap of a finger. Why? Simplybecause computer related courses were the most in demand during that time. Withouta second thought, I chose BS Computer Science instead of BS Accountancy. I soothedimyself with the end in mind of working at least in an office after graduationTime flew fast, I finally graduated from college. After graduation, I startedlooking for a job. And every time I saw my mother, who was a high school teacher,kept on telling myself that I was very fortunate for I was not a teacher. Still, I did notwant to be like her. Until one day, after several months of job hunting, I was finallyhired! To my biggest surprise, I was employed as a high school computer TEACHER.never imagined teaching for I know how difficult it was but now, I realized howmuch joy teaching has given me. For a mother like me, I see teaching similar toparenting Raising a learner is like raising your own child. Truly, to teach is to touchives Like Henry Adams, I believe that a teacher affects eternity, and no one knowswhere his/her influence stops. Indeed, it is from NEVER to FOREVER ​</h2><br />

"I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that they are not troubledwith fears of poverty, but are troubled with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in their several places.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Rulers of the state and chiefs of families are most troubled about maintaining order and keeping their people in their designated places within society. They are concerned with ensuring that the people are content and at peace, rather than worried about poverty or the number of people in their society.</p><p></p><p>The state should satisfy the people by ensuring that they are content in their designated places within society and by promoting harmony and order. It should also cultivate virtues and civil culture to attract and subdue any unruly or rebellious people.</p><p></p><p>The principle mentioned in the last paragraph is that people should strive to fulfill their designated roles within society and not try to rise above their place or seek power that is not rightfully theirs. This means that people should be content with their position and not try to disrupt the social order.</p><p></p><p>The ideal state of governance inferred from the selection is one where the rulers are concerned with the contentment and well-being of the people, and where the people fulfill their designated roles within society. This state is characterized by harmony, order, and virtue, and is governed by principles of justice and fairness.</p><br />
