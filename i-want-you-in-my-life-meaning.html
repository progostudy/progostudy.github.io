                                            Read the poem Faith is walking not by sight but by assurance,Forgetting my doubt and relying in His guidance.I will prepare to make and keep sacred covenants,And live with God's blessings with gratefulness and countenance.I will live my life to claim the blessing that God is with us,And I will testify that God is my shelter and my only God.He is my companion as I grow each day,And I will walk by faith, letting Him take care of my concerns all day.Divine I am in nature by inheritance,I will not let him down with my arrogance.The Spirit whispers of my mission and my individual worth,So, I seek for precious knowledge for learning and for growth.I understand the meaning of accountability,Every choice for good or is my responsibility.I want to build the kingdom and good work is the key;By doing what I know is right I show integrity.Answer the following questions based on the poem you read.1. How does the poet live his life?2. In what ways does he prove his spiritual growth?3. What does the poet continue to seek for?​​</a>

My classes started at seven o`clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health and the following year I was taken by my father to San Juan De Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to manila ans spoke to my Dominican professors who by this time, had become very fond of me and. told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer but could not pray for my expenses. They secured a position for me as one of the helpersin the University of Santo Tomas with eoom and board and free tuition. Thus I was able to take up the study of law."1.

                                            (THE QUESTION IS IN THE PHOTO).STORY:I was quite happy in my new place, and if there was one thing that I missed it must not be thought I was discontented; all who had to do with me were good and I had a light airy stable and the best of food. What more could I want? Why, liberty! For three years and a half of my life I had had all the liberty I could wish for; but now, week after week, month after month, and no doubt year after year, I must stand up in a stable night and day except when I am wanted, and then I must be just as steady and quiet as any old horse who has worked twenty years. Straps here and straps there, a bit in my mouth, and blinkers over my eyes. Now, I am not complaining, for I know it must be so. I only mean to say that for a young horse full of strength and spirits, who has been used to some large field or plain where he can fling up his head and toss up his tail and gallop away at full speed, then round and back again with a snort to his companions - I say it is hard never to have a bit more liberty to do as you like. Sometimes, when I have had less exercise than usual, Ihave felt so full of life and spring that when John has taken me out to exercise I really could not keep quiet; do what I would, it seemed as if I must jump, or dance, or prance, and many a good shake I know I must have given him, especially at the first; but he was always good and patient.(THE QUESTION IS IN THE PHOTO.)​</a>

                                            how messed up is this?!
 my mom turned off my phone number for 6 months unless I can get my grades up. (i have mostly d's and a couple of f's and one c...) and now my dad can't call me or use the tracker. no number means no tracker. and I have a hard time sleeping as it is. I wake up late a lot of the time but before I would have people call me in the mornings to wake me up. I have 2 alarms that go off. and yesterday I decided to use my third one. I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</a>

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that the days and years go by while
I am living with a, living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive

The Telephone by Edward Field
My Happiness depends on an electric appliance
And I do not mind giving it so much credit
With life in this city being what it is
Each person separated from friends
By a tangle of subways and buses
Yes my telephone is my joy
It tells me that I am in the word and wanted
It rings and I am alerted to love or gossip
I go comb my hair which begins to sparkle
Without it I was like a bear in a cave
Drowsing through a shadowy winter
It rings and spring has come
I stretch and amble out into the sunshine
Hungry again as I pick up the receiver
For the human voice and the good news of friends
Please help me. Thank you</a>

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This quote by Peter De Vries tries to discuss the mystery of life by comparing it to a safe. As we all know, a vault or safe needs a combination to unlock it. The challenge here is that the correct answer exists, but it is trapped inside. There is no way to cheat by peeking inside because it is protected. By likening the secret of the universe to this puzzle, he is saying that it is hard to solve the mystery. However, it is not impossible. There is only one thing to do, which is to try different combinations and never give up. If you do this, it is only a matter of time before you crack the code. This is also true for life. As long as you keep trying no matter how hard it gets, you will get there eventually. When you finally get it right, you will understand and realize the way the universe works at last.</p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The quote is actually an analogy!

My classes started at seven o`clock in the morning and I had to get up very early to reach my classes on time. Again, this impaired my health and the following year I was taken by my father to San Juan De Letran as an intern. I remained as an intern until I graduated as A.B. with the highest honors. By this time the savings of my father had all been spent on my education. He owed money and simply told me that I had to stop my studies unless I could work my way through university education. I came to manila ans spoke to my Dominican professors who by this time, had become very fond of me and. told them of my situation. I wanted to be a lawyer but could not pray for my expenses.

                            10. (THE QUESTION IS IN THE PHOTO).STORY:I was quite happy in my new place, and if there was one thing that I missed it must not be thought I was discontented; all who had to do with me were good and I had a light airy stable and the best of food. What more could I want? Why, liberty! For three years and a half of my life I had had all the liberty I could wish for; but now, week after week, month after month, and no doubt year after year, I must stand up in a stable night and day except when I am wanted, and then I must be just as steady and quiet as any old horse who has worked twenty years. Straps here and straps there, a bit in my mouth, and blinkers over my eyes. Now, I am not complaining, for I know it must be so. I only mean to say that for a young horse full of strength and spirits, who has been used to some large field or plain where he can fling up his head and toss up his tail and gallop away at full speed, then round and back again with a snort to his companions - I say it is hard never to have a bit more liberty to do as you like. Sometimes, when I have had less exercise than usual, Ihave felt so full of life and spring that when John has taken me out to exercise I really could not keep quiet; do what I would, it seemed as if I must jump, or dance, or prance, and many a good shake I know I must have given him, especially at the first; but he was always good and patient.(THE QUESTION IS IN THE PHOTO.)​</h2><br />

The universe is like a safe to which there is a combination. But the combination is locked up in the safe."2. Worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing Bubble gum."3. I am to dancing what Roseanne is to singing and donald duck to movitational speeches. I am as graceful as a refrigerator falling down a flight of stairs."​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> This quote by Peter De Vries tries to discuss the mystery of life by comparing it to a safe. As we all know, a vault or safe needs a combination to unlock it. The challenge here is that<strong> </strong>the correct answer exists, but it is trapped inside. There is no way to cheat by peeking inside because it is protected. By likening the secret of the universe to this puzzle, he is saying that it is hard to solve the mystery.
</p><p>However, it is not impossible. There is only one thing to do, which is to try different combinations and never give up. If you do this, it is only a matter of time before you crack the code. The summary of this is to keep trying and never give up. Eventually, you will find the secret. When you have found it, you will realize and understand the way the universe works at last. </p><p><strong>2. </strong>Chewing bubble gum won't solve any algebra equation, which is why the text said "worrying is as effective as trying to solve an equation by chewing bubble gum." It means that worrying won't solve any problem because chewing bubble gum while doing an equation is also not effective.</p><p><strong>Sorry but I don't know what #3 means, but I hope the #1 and #2 answers helped you. :)</strong></p><br />

 my mom turned off my phone number for 6 months unless I can get my grades up. (i have mostly d's and a couple of f's and one c...) and now my dad can't call me or use the tracker. no number means no tracker. and I have a hard time sleeping as it is. I wake up late a lot of the time but before I would have people call me in the mornings to wake me up. I have 2 alarms that go off. and yesterday I decided to use my third one. I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</h2><br />

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that the days and years go by while
I am living with a, living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive

The Telephone by Edward Field
My Happiness depends on an electric appliance
And I do not mind giving it so much credit
With life in this city being what it is
Each person separated from friends
By a tangle of subways and buses
Yes my telephone is my joy
It tells me that I am in the word and wanted
It rings and I am alerted to love or gossip
I go comb my hair which begins to sparkle
Without it I was like a bear in a cave
Drowsing through a shadowy winter
It rings and spring has come
I stretch and amble out into the sunshine
Hungry again as I pick up the receiver
For the human voice and the good news of friends
Please help me. Thank you</h2><br />
