Structuralist/Formalist, B. Moralist, C. Marxist, D. Feminist, E. Historical F. Reader-Response. Write only the letter of the expected answer on a separate sheet. _________7. Study The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. This book takes place in the American South in the 19th century and follows a white boy, Huck, as he helps a black slave, Jim, escape his situation. Here we've got quite a bit more detail. Instead of just two large classes, society is divided into several smaller ones (Study.com. Accessed August 28, 2020).__________ 8. Judith Little and Megan S. Lloyd argue that Alice is a "literally underground image of a woman" battling the "system." Still, they also view Alice's insistence, activity, and curiosity as typically "Un-Victorian" traits that make her an example of a seditious woman. But for Lloyd, Alice can also be considered as an ideal role model for any society simultaneously (Criticism of 'Alice'. Accessed August 17, 2020).___________ 9. Samuel Johnson once stressed in his novel entitled, The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia the following words: "I have here the world before me; I will review it at leisure: surely happiness is somewhere to be found... Happiness must be something solid and permanent, without fear and without uncertainty." He simply recounts the story of a prince 'who escapes from the valley of happiness,' to search for perpetual bliss. However, he realizes that this kind of happiness does not exist (“Moral - Examples and Definition of Moral.” Literary Devices, May 28, 2017) ___________10. Through Phoenix's strenuous journey in the wild country of Natchez Trace, Eudora Welty uses her protagonist to symbolically show the struggle of African-Americans toward equality and integration in the South after the Civil War (Writing a Formalist Literary Analysis.

Instead of just two large classes, society is divided into several smaller ones (Study.com. Accessed August 28, 2020). __________ 8. Judith Little and Megan S. Lloyd argue that Alice is a "literally underground image of a woman" battling the "system." Still, they also view Alice's insistence, activity, and curiosity as typically "Un-Victorian" traits that make her an example of a seditious woman. But for Lloyd, Alice can also be considered as an ideal role model for any society simultaneously (Criticism of 'Alice'. Accessed August 17, 2020). ___________ 9.

Happiness must be something solid and permanent, without fear and without uncertainty." He simply recounts the story of a prince 'who escapes from the valley of happiness,' to search for perpetual bliss. However, he realizes that this kind of happiness does not exist (“Moral - Examples and Definition of Moral.” Literary Devices, May 28, 2017) ___________10.
