1. Although friendship is something that most people enjoy, friendship are not all the same. Some friendships are forged from a long-term familiarity with one another, and other friendships can spring up just by spending one fun evening together. Not all friendships result in daily or even weekly time spent together; long-term friendships can be kept afloat using communication tools like the Internet and mobile phone, while other friendships result in sporadic get-togethers sometimes months or even years apart. People seek different things in friendship, meaning certain friendships result around trips to a dinner or video games while other friendships may occur due to a work relationship or general common interests.

                                            What is the best summary for this text?Perhaps the only thing more elusive than a ninja is the source of the word ninja.  In Japan ninja are more often referred to as shinobi.  The word shinobi, short for shinobi-no-mono, means “to steal away.”  The word shinobi appears in poems as far back as the eighth century.  So how did this word become ninja?  Some believe that during the Edo period in Japan, those word shinobi-no-mono was transformed to the very similar word ninja.  This probably happened because it was a lot quicker and easier to just say ninja.  It is difficult to see how such a transformation could have occurred when we look at the words using our alphabet, but if you look at the kanji representing these words, it may make more sense to you.  Select one:a. Ninja word was used because it was easier to to say than the word shinobi. b. The word ninja has mysterious origins, but it probably derived from the word shinobi-no-mono, which looks nothing like ninja in English but is very similar in kanji. c. Ninja are more often referred to as shinobi.  This started in Edo period in Japan.​</a>

School uniforms are good for the development of children. First of all, everyone is dressed unified. So no one has"better” clothes than others and no one can threaten others only because of their clothes. In many schools ganging up on othersbecause of what they are wearing is already normal and uniforms are a way to protect the children from such acts.School uniforms also keep everyone from having to buy expensive brand of clothes to be part of the society, which relievesespecially the parents and takes the pressure of being "cool" awayfrom the children. School uniforms also help to put, off children being overly concerned about keeping up with the latestfashions. This gives young children more time to concentrate on more important developmental things. Of course, there arealso critics, who say that school uniforms make the children lose their own individuality but in general it is possible to say, thatschool uniforms have a good influence on most children. (Expository)2. The school fair is right around the corner, and tickets have just gone on sale. We are selling a limited number of ticketsat discounts, so move fast and get yours while they are still available. This is going to be an event you will not want to miss!(Persuasive)3. Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of itsbeautiful experiences. But, despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which I am sure I willcarry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. (Narrative)4. Studies have shown that lucky people tend to be far more open to new experiences. Those who are unlucky arecreatures of habit, never varying from one day to the next. If you want to be lucky, add some variety to your life. Meet newpeople, go to the new places, and increase the possibility of those chance opportunities the “lucky' people always seem to runinto. (Persuasive)5. Pat Mora's poem, "Echoes," vividly describes the meaning and mood of the poem by using sensory images. At thebeginning of the poem it was talking about white wine and cool dresses which give you a feel of upperclass elegance. Yet when itwent from the white wine to the white uniform it changed the class of the hostess and the maid. When it mentioned that themaid's smile wavered when the speaker started to talk to her, it showed the level of amazement that the maid felt. However, theend, when it talks about hearing the cruel comment of “just drop the cups and plates / on the grass," it gave the poem a feelingof darkness as the poem told how the speaker stood in silence which describes her contradicting feelings. Towardsthe end of the poem the roar and flash help the reader envision the speaker's rage for the cruelty that is being calmed in a racistsociety. (Explanatory)D.

My apartment was down a dimly-lit narrow hallway covered in womfiftles style dark green carpeting. When I say apartment, I really mean room, because there was justone smali square room with a tiny bathroom. The air was humid and musty. One small window provideda perfect view of the brown stucco wall of the bullding next door. A small "avocado" colored stove andfridge highlighted the kitchen which consisted of a few shabby painted wood cupboards that projectedInto the room. Along one wall was an older pale blue sofa, which was also my bed. A small red cardtable with two chairs served as my kitchen and dining room table. A few feet away, several largePage 1 of 3​</a>

                                            The Cobra Effect The British colonized India from 1858 to 1947. That means that they ruled the country. They governed the Indian people. They used India to make wealth for the British Empire. But they also developed India. They built canals and railroads. They tried to make India more like the United Kingdom. Yet India was different from the UK. It was more rustic. The ecology was different too. Some British colonists had a hard time adapting. The snakes were particularly troubling. The capital area of Delhi was overrun with venomous cobras. Encountering a cobra is quite frightening. It's even worse getting bit by one. The cobras killed many colonists. Enough died that the British government took action. They paid a bounty for every dead cobra. The program was a success at first. Many people hunted and killed the cobras for the rewards. The number of cobras dropped. The colonists felt safer. But then it became harder to catch cobras. So enterprising people started breeding them. After all, it is easier to catch a pet cobra than a wild one. News of this scheme got back to the British government. They learned that people were breeding cobras to earn rewards. This is not what the British wanted to happen. They felt foolish. They scrapped the program. Now the breeders were angry. Raising cobras can be challenging. They were doing it for the money. When the program ended, the snakes were worthless. So the breeders released them into the wild. Now there were more wild cobras than when the program started. The British plan seemed like a good idea at first. In practice though, it made things much worse. This is the cobra effect. The cobra effect is when a solution worsens a problem. Many well-intentioned programs backfire. In 2014 the City of Chicago banned lightweight plastic bags. Single use bags are bad for the environment. They end up in the water. They pollute the land. City officials wanted people to reuse bags. So they put a tax on lightweight bags. Retailers did not want to anger customers with the new tax. So they made their bags much thicker. The new bags were 150 times thicker than the old bags. The thicker bags were no longer lightweight, so they weren't taxed. But most customers did not reuse these bags. They just threw away the really thick plastic bags. This is another example of the cobra effect. The city intended to reduce plastic waste, yet the tax worsened it 150 fold. Our actions do not always have the consequences that we expect. 1. Which best defines the word colonize as used in the FIRST paragraph? To destroy or ruin a foreign land		C. To trade or do business with other people To inhabit and rule a foreign land		D. To do battle or fight with another group of people 2. Which conclusion can be supported with text from the passage? India had MORE poisonous snakes than the UK.	 India had FEWER poisonous snakes than the UK. India had the SAME amount of poisonous snakes as UK India DID NOT have poisonous snakes. 3. Which event happened LAST? The number of snakes decreased. The government began paying a bounty for dead snakes. The snake breeders released their cobras into the wild. People started breeding snakes.​</a>

Casually her mother said, “If you hold a chick too tightly, it wants only to get away. Try holding one gently.”	The next chick nestled peacefully in Armida’s open palm. Her mother said, “You know dear, people are the same as chicks. If we hold those whom we love too closely to us, they will struggle for freedom. Hold them with open hands and they won’t feel smothered or suffocated.	Armida understood the message in her mother’s words.

27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

My dear Jen, I never had an education. My parents believed that I was not worthy to be sent to school, that I was better off as a housemaid. I only learned to read and to write when your Papa taught me. He was the only person in my life who supported and believed in me. Life has been so unfair to me. Every- thing does not seem to fall in proper places. Life and people were so hard on me, that is why I find it hard to trust people easily. I knew that I would come to this point, and forgive me if I could not tum my fate around. This is it Promise me, my dear Jen, that you will change the course of your fate.

                                            SAMPLE CRITIQUE
 "Lee" published by Crime Factory (Posted by Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46:00PM)
 I recently finished a fiction anthology called "Lee." The book features seventeen short stories, all written by
 crime writers and inspired by Lee Marvin - his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the
 first taking place in 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goofy
 and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had
 published two of my short stories. I liked what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else
 they've brought to the world.
 I am happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns
 out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled
 the task of writing a Lee Marvin-inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: Just Swell," "Cameron Ashley,
 ""1967: The Gun Hunter." Eric Beetner's novel The Devil Doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three or
 my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June.
 I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with these writers tangentially.
 Finishing "Lee" has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched The Man who Sho
 Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I'd seen
 another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff, but I took a step forward
 correcting this oversight last night by watching The Dirty Dozen - awesome!
 1. Where does the writer present some background and summary of the text?
 2. Would you say the background information about the text is enough? Why?
 3. What does the writer say about the different narrative elements?
 4. Is the evaluation exhaustive? Why yes? Why not?
 Consider these:
 o Notice that the writer presents the background and the summary in the first paragraph.
 o
 However, the background is not enough to inform the readers what "Lee" is all about, making them unable to
 relate to the critic's impressions about it.
 o Actually, there was no evident attempt to analyze the plot, characters, and others. What is obvious are the writer'
 s personal reactions to "Lee" and his failure to support his judgement about the material. In other words, this
 sample critique fails to make an in-depth evaluation of the text; hence, it is really not informative.
 o Thus, the evaluation was not exhaustive. There wasn't any exhaustive analysis of the material to really support
 the critic's evaluation. He seems very familiar with the material, and he could do a better critique of it.</a>

1. Although friendship is something that most people enjoy, friendship are not all the same. Some friendships are forged from a long-term familiarity with one another, and other friendships can spring up just by spending one fun evening together. Not all friendships result in daily or even weekly time spent together; long-term friendships can be kept afloat using communication tools like the Internet and mobile phone, while other friendships result in sporadic get-togethers sometimes months or even years apart. People seek different things in friendship, meaning certain friendships result around trips to a dinner or video games while other friendships may occur due to a work relationship or general common interests.

                            3. What is the best summary for this text?Perhaps the only thing more elusive than a ninja is the source of the word ninja.  In Japan ninja are more often referred to as shinobi.  The word shinobi, short for shinobi-no-mono, means “to steal away.”  The word shinobi appears in poems as far back as the eighth century.  So how did this word become ninja?  Some believe that during the Edo period in Japan, those word shinobi-no-mono was transformed to the very similar word ninja.  This probably happened because it was a lot quicker and easier to just say ninja.  It is difficult to see how such a transformation could have occurred when we look at the words using our alphabet, but if you look at the kanji representing these words, it may make more sense to you.  Select one:a. Ninja word was used because it was easier to to say than the word shinobi. b. The word ninja has mysterious origins, but it probably derived from the word shinobi-no-mono, which looks nothing like ninja in English but is very similar in kanji. c. Ninja are more often referred to as shinobi.  This started in Edo period in Japan.​</h2><br />

School uniforms are good for the development of children. First of all, everyone is dressed unified. So no one has"better” clothes than others and no one can threaten others only because of their clothes. In many schools ganging up on othersbecause of what they are wearing is already normal and uniforms are a way to protect the children from such acts.School uniforms also keep everyone from having to buy expensive brand of clothes to be part of the society, which relievesespecially the parents and takes the pressure of being "cool" awayfrom the children. School uniforms also help to put, off children being overly concerned about keeping up with the latestfashions. This gives young children more time to concentrate on more important developmental things. Of course, there arealso critics, who say that school uniforms make the children lose their own individuality but in general it is possible to say, thatschool uniforms have a good influence on most children. (Expository)2. The school fair is right around the corner, and tickets have just gone on sale. We are selling a limited number of ticketsat discounts, so move fast and get yours while they are still available. This is going to be an event you will not want to miss!(Persuasive)3. Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of itsbeautiful experiences. But, despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which I am sure I willcarry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. (Narrative)4. Studies have shown that lucky people tend to be far more open to new experiences. Those who are unlucky arecreatures of habit, never varying from one day to the next. If you want to be lucky, add some variety to your life. Meet newpeople, go to the new places, and increase the possibility of those chance opportunities the “lucky' people always seem to runinto. (Persuasive)5. Pat Mora's poem, "Echoes," vividly describes the meaning and mood of the poem by using sensory images. At thebeginning of the poem it was talking about white wine and cool dresses which give you a feel of upperclass elegance. Yet when itwent from the white wine to the white uniform it changed the class of the hostess and the maid. When it mentioned that themaid's smile wavered when the speaker started to talk to her, it showed the level of amazement that the maid felt. However, theend, when it talks about hearing the cruel comment of “just drop the cups and plates / on the grass," it gave the poem a feelingof darkness as the poem told how the speaker stood in silence which describes her contradicting feelings. Towardsthe end of the poem the roar and flash help the reader envision the speaker's rage for the cruelty that is being calmed in a racistsociety. (Explanatory)D.

                            10. The Cobra Effect The British colonized India from 1858 to 1947. That means that they ruled the country. They governed the Indian people. They used India to make wealth for the British Empire. But they also developed India. They built canals and railroads. They tried to make India more like the United Kingdom. Yet India was different from the UK. It was more rustic. The ecology was different too. Some British colonists had a hard time adapting. The snakes were particularly troubling. The capital area of Delhi was overrun with venomous cobras. Encountering a cobra is quite frightening. It's even worse getting bit by one. The cobras killed many colonists. Enough died that the British government took action. They paid a bounty for every dead cobra. The program was a success at first. Many people hunted and killed the cobras for the rewards. The number of cobras dropped. The colonists felt safer. But then it became harder to catch cobras. So enterprising people started breeding them. After all, it is easier to catch a pet cobra than a wild one. News of this scheme got back to the British government. They learned that people were breeding cobras to earn rewards. This is not what the British wanted to happen. They felt foolish. They scrapped the program. Now the breeders were angry. Raising cobras can be challenging. They were doing it for the money. When the program ended, the snakes were worthless. So the breeders released them into the wild. Now there were more wild cobras than when the program started. The British plan seemed like a good idea at first. In practice though, it made things much worse. This is the cobra effect. The cobra effect is when a solution worsens a problem. Many well-intentioned programs backfire. In 2014 the City of Chicago banned lightweight plastic bags. Single use bags are bad for the environment. They end up in the water. They pollute the land. City officials wanted people to reuse bags. So they put a tax on lightweight bags. Retailers did not want to anger customers with the new tax. So they made their bags much thicker. The new bags were 150 times thicker than the old bags. The thicker bags were no longer lightweight, so they weren't taxed. But most customers did not reuse these bags. They just threw away the really thick plastic bags. This is another example of the cobra effect. The city intended to reduce plastic waste, yet the tax worsened it 150 fold. Our actions do not always have the consequences that we expect. 1. Which best defines the word colonize as used in the FIRST paragraph? To destroy or ruin a foreign land		C. To trade or do business with other people To inhabit and rule a foreign land		D. To do battle or fight with another group of people 2. Which conclusion can be supported with text from the passage? India had MORE poisonous snakes than the UK.	 India had FEWER poisonous snakes than the UK. India had the SAME amount of poisonous snakes as UK India DID NOT have poisonous snakes. 3. Which event happened LAST? The number of snakes decreased. The government began paying a bounty for dead snakes. The snake breeders released their cobras into the wild. People started breeding snakes.​</h2><br />

27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

Dear Jen, Forgive me if I failed to be a good mother. Forgive me if I failed to make you my princess and to stand beside you like a queen. Sorry, if I failed you. My dear Jen, I never had an education. My parents believed that I was not worthy to be sent to school, that I was better off as a housemaid. I only learned to read and to write when your Papa taught me. He was the only person in my life who supported and believed in me. Life has been so unfair to me. Every- thing does not seem to fall in proper places. Life and people were so hard on me, that is why I find it hard to trust people easily. I knew that I would come to this point, and forgive me if I could not tum my fate around. This is it Promise me, my dear Jen, that you will change the course of your fate. The road that I took was rough and hard, but that does not mean that you will take the same route. I may leave you physically, but I will always be with you in all your journeys.

                            16. SAMPLE CRITIQUE
 "Lee" published by Crime Factory (Posted by Abdulat 8/10/2008 12:46:00PM)
 I recently finished a fiction anthology called "Lee." The book features seventeen short stories, all written by
 crime writers and inspired by Lee Marvin - his life, his movies. The stories flow in chronological order with the
 first taking place in 1944 and the last in 1987, just after Lee died. Frankly, I thought the concept was a little goofy
 and I didn't really expect the book to be that good. I bought it only because its publisher, Crime Factory, had
 published two of my short stories. I liked what they'd done in their journal, and figured I'd check out what else
 they've brought to the world.
 I am happy to admit that I was very wrong. Not only is every story in the collection really good, but it turns
 out that the concept really worked. In a word, the book rocks! It was fun to see how the different authors tackled
 the task of writing a Lee Marvin-inspired story. I particularly liked the stories: "1966: Just Swell," "Cameron Ashley,
 ""1967: The Gun Hunter." Eric Beetner's novel The Devil Doesn't Want Me has now moved up to number three or
 my reading list, which hopefully means I'll get to it in June.
 I feel good that in my own little way I'm associated with these writers tangentially.
 Finishing "Lee" has also made me more interested in Lee Marvin's movies. I watched The Man who Sho
 Liberty Valence during a film class in college and was blown away by his performance, but I don't think I'd seen
 another one of his movies. And I consider myself something of an old film buff, but I took a step forward
 correcting this oversight last night by watching The Dirty Dozen - awesome!
 1. Where does the writer present some background and summary of the text?
 2. Would you say the background information about the text is enough? Why?
 3. What does the writer say about the different narrative elements?
 4. Is the evaluation exhaustive? Why yes? Why not?
 Consider these:
 o Notice that the writer presents the background and the summary in the first paragraph.
 o
 However, the background is not enough to inform the readers what "Lee" is all about, making them unable to
 relate to the critic's impressions about it.
 o Actually, there was no evident attempt to analyze the plot, characters, and others. What is obvious are the writer'
 s personal reactions to "Lee" and his failure to support his judgement about the material. In other words, this
 sample critique fails to make an in-depth evaluation of the text; hence, it is really not informative.
 o Thus, the evaluation was not exhaustive. There wasn't any exhaustive analysis of the material to really support
 the critic's evaluation. He seems very familiar with the material, and he could do a better critique of it.</h2><br />

Dogs Rule                by: Luke See    Dogs are the greatest pets ever. There is really no denying it. Goldfish, hamsters, and cats do not compare. "What makes dogs so great?" you mightask. That's easy. They are affectionate, smart, and easy to care for.    If you have a tough day at school, what do you want to come home to? Do you want to come home to a cat that just looks at you, bored, until youfeed it? No way! How about coming home to a loving dog instead? If you are sad, a good dog will comfort you right away. A dog will jump up on your lap and lick your face until you can't help but smile. Dogs are also super smart! They can play fun games, like fetch. This also means that they are easy to train. You can teach your dog to use the bathroom outside. Most dogs learnthis pretty fast and don't forget it. You can also teach a dog some tricks. With some patience and a couple treats, you can train your dog to put on a show.     Last, dogs are easy to take care of. As long as you feed them, love them, and train them, caring for a dog is a breeze. You don't have to worry about cleaning out a dirty litter box or fishbowl. If you are thinking about getting a new pet, you should choose a dog. After all, they are man's best friend.1. What is the author's point of view expressed in the selection?2-4.
