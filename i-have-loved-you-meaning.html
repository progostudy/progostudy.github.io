                                            THE MARTYR 
By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.

People nowadays, in this modern life have lost sight of what have similarities but they also have their differences. The key to opening up the world of friendship and love is. Friends do not have to be exactly the same, I mean, friends do friendship is not just to focus on the similarities but to accept each other's faults because true friends do not judge each other. Friends love unconditionally.

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that the days and years go by while
I am living with a, living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive

                                            The Martyr Being in love means never having to say you’re sorry After all, at some point in your life That love was the most important thing to you, That love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, That love made you believe that destiny does exist, And that love made you question, Why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't even think twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, I was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, Just so I could be with you. All I ever did was care for you. All I ever did was to make you happy. And all I ever did was love you. Being in love means never having to say you’re sorry But I needed to ask forgiveness from the one who was hurt the most… Myself 1. what is the imagery of the poem? 2. what is the mood of the poem?​</a>

Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</a>

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</a>

                            4. THE MARTYR 
By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.

The tone may be expressing heartbreak or sorrow.</p><p></p><p>3.) I think Nick Joaquin wrote this poem so he could express himself, that he is heartbroken, that he is dejected, that he is depressed, and that he is disappointed towards the one he loved.</p><p></p><p>4.) I think it's about the heartbreak that the poet experienced towards a lover or a love interest whom he gave all the love he can offer.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1) The saying "It is better to give than to receive" implies that it is more fulfilling to be the giver rather than the receiver in any kind of transaction. However, this can be seen as contradictory as sometimes receiving can bring joy and happiness to people's lives.</p><p></p><p>2) The quote by Mother Teresa highlights the paradoxical nature of love, where the more love you give, the more love you receive. It suggests that love has the power to overcome any hurt or pain, and that by loving selflessly, you can find more love and happiness.</p><p></p><p>3) The saying "in order for seed to grow, it must die" refers to the idea that sometimes in order to achieve growth or transformation, something must come to an end or be sacrificed. It suggests that the process of transformation can be painful, but necessary for new growth to occur. This can be seen as contradictory as it implies that in order for something to live, it must first die.</p><br />

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that the days and years go by while
I am living with a, living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive

                            19. The Martyr Being in love means never having to say you’re sorry After all, at some point in your life That love was the most important thing to you, That love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, That love made you believe that destiny does exist, And that love made you question, Why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't even think twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, I was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, Just so I could be with you. All I ever did was care for you. All I ever did was to make you happy. And all I ever did was love you. Being in love means never having to say you’re sorry But I needed to ask forgiveness from the one who was hurt the most… Myself 1. what is the imagery of the poem? 2. what is the mood of the poem?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>In truth, I think the meaning of the song, is that whoever was singing this, wanted to seek and find God. They state in a few verses that he/she was made by God, and yet, they have never seen him. They ask of God to teach him/her how to find him, to seek him. They state that they cannot see him, unless he teaches them, or that they cannot find him unless he shows himself to them. They want to love God when they find him, and they want him to teach their hearts on how to find him.</strong></p><p><strong>The line that I found interesting was:</strong></p><p><strong>"</strong><strong>Teach my heart where to find You, for I cannot see You unless You teach me, or find You unless You show yourself to me."</strong></p><p><strong>I found it interesting because it shows that no matter how hard we try, only God can show himself. No amount of will and force can make God show himself to us. It is him we need to find, not the other way around. We are not the ones who will show ourselves to him, but rather, he would show himself to us.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            27. 1. Read the provided essay.
2. Create a critique of the topic and evaluate whether or not the text is worth sharing
with other people.
Life without a car is hard, especially when you live in the Philippines. The chaos that people
I have to go through just to go work and get home using public transportation is such a
hassle. It is very time consuming, so instead of enjoying the hours left in a day with your
family, you spend them jostling with other commuters and struggling to find a ride instead.
But owning a car has its own pros and cons.
On the positive side, having a car gives you more time to do what you want, like go on trips
with your friends and carpool with your officemates. You can also travel to and from work
in comfort.
As for the negative, not everyone can afford to buy a car with cold, hard cash, meaning, you
have to pay for the car in monthly installments on top of your usual bills. You also have to
consider the fuel costs, car maintenance costs, and toll fees. As for me? I think a bit more
expense is worth it if it means I get to spend more time with my loved ones and do the
things I love.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The topic presented is a personal opinion on the pros and cons of owning a car in the Philippines. The writer discusses the inconvenience of relying on public transportation and the benefits of owning a car. They acknowledge the financial burden that comes with owning a car but believe that the additional expense is worth the benefits it provides.</p><p></p><p>While the writer's personal experience and perspective are valid, the article could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the issue. For instance, the article does not consider the environmental impact of owning a car, which is a significant concern in the modern world. Additionally, the writer does not consider alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or motorcycles, which could provide similar benefits at a lower cost.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the article lacks statistical evidence or research to back up the claims made, which would have added credibility to the author's opinion. The writer could have provided additional sources and data to support their argument and provide a more well-rounded view of the topic.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the article provides a personal opinion on owning a car in the Philippines, but it lacks a thorough analysis of the issue. It could benefit from more research and evidence to support the author's perspective. However, the topic is still worth sharing with others as it can initiate a conversation on the pros and cons of owning a car and encourage people to consider alternative modes of transportation.</p><br />

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</h2><br />
