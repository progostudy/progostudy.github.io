                                            “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.	What is the basis of national strength, according to the essay? Do you agree? Explain your answer. 2.	What are the peaks, valleys and deep chasms which could hinder the upward climb of mankind? 3.	What does the author want the Filipino to be? Can this goal be achieved? 4.	What values must we possess to be able to achieve the author’s perceived goal for us?​</a>

One sunny day, my little puppy jumped onto our red couch and played with his new toy. I liked to watch him play and it made me feel happy? Soon my playful puppy yawned. He was a tired puppy. I picked him up and laid him on his soft, round bed. Soon, my sleepy puppy was snoring away. _______________________________________ Chilled strawberry ice cream is an amazing treat. It is very creamy and has a very smooth texture. Pineapple slices make it colorful. Strawberries add bright and red color too. It also makes an ice cream taste wonderful. White soft cream is added to make the dessert look beautiful. The ice cream is served with crispy biscuit to make it tastes more delicious. _______________________________________ Seashells belong to mollusca or mollusks. There are more than 100,000 kinds of mollusks living in the sea for about 500 million years now. There are many classifications of mollusks. Two of these are being single-shelled and two-shelled. Single-shelled mollusks crawl using their muscle that acts as their foot. Their shells are usually spiraling. Two-shelled mollusks have two valves joining by hinges. These open and close the valves of the shell. _______________________________________ The warm weather allows me to play outside. I play under the sprinkler with my younger brother. We run through the cold water and scream each time! At night, I play hide and seek with my good friends. I usually hide in a big bush; I love it when the weather is warm! _______________________________________ Dogs are domesticated animals that have been living with humans with generations. Dogs can be classified in several different ways. They can be classified by breed. Examples include beagles, basset hounds, poodles and countless others are defined by the American Kennel Club (AKC). They can also be classified by their role in the lives of their masters and the work they do. For example, a dog might be a family pet, a working dog, a show dog, or a hunting dog. In many cases, dogs are defined both by their breed and their roll. For example, a dog could be a beagle that is a family pet. ​</a>

GROW AND BE LIKE THE MOLAVE
by Manuel Luis quezon
National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It
is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component
parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of
vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave,
industrious, self-reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbeud with sound
patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and
I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from
trials and bitter strifes of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task
and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind.
The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and
valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in
proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights.
The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among
men.
It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly
they should be morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited.
I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood,
the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength.
we are orientals. orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. in the world of humanity, we look upon a quit lake from which adventures and enteprising may reap enjoyment and gain. i refuse to allow filipinos to be so regarded.
we shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. through self discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace.

                                            E. ASSESSMENT Read the selection below and make a summary of it, The Functions of Emotions Imagine what it would be like if we didn't experience emotion--no depths of despair, no depression, no remorse, but at the same time no happiness, joy, or love. Obviously, life would be considerably less satisfying, and even dull, if we lacked the capacity to sense and express emotion. But do emotions serve any purpose beyond making life interesting? Indeed, they do. Psychologists have identified several important functions that emotions play in our daily lives. Emotions prepare us for action. Emotions act as a link between events in our environment and our responses. For example, if we saw an angry dog charging toward us, the emotional reaction (fear) would be associated with the activation of the "fighter-flight" response. This prepares us for emergency action, which presumably would get us out of the dog's way-quickly. Emotions shape our future behavior. Emotions promote learning that will help us make appropriate responses in the future. For example, the emotional response that occurs when we experience something unpleasant-such as a threatening dog- teaches us to avoid similar circumstances in the future. In the same way, pleasant emotions act as positive reinforcement for prior behavior and therefore may lead an individual to seek similar situations in the future. Emotions help us interact more effectively with others. We often communicate the emotions we experience through our verbal and nonverbal behaviors, making our emotions obvious to observers. These behaviors can act as a signal to observers, allowing them to understand better what we are experiencing and predict our future behavior. In turn, this promotes more effective and appropriate social interaction.need ko po answernon sense report ​</a>

THE PURPOSE OF OUR LIVES IS TO BE HAPPY :)
 - DALAI LAMA -</h2><br />
                        Answer:<p>Many people do not think about the purpose of life or if they do, they find purpose in family or work. Often the blind acquisition of material goods or earning money may be a purpose. Happiness is considered by many to be a lucky condition enjoyed occasionally by chance circumstances.</p><p></p><p>However the Dalai Lama here reminds us that the whole purpose of life is to be happy. A deceptively simple yet deep assertion. To be continually happy is not easy for most people. Worries about money, family or work can upset our mental and emotional balance.</p><p></p><p>So we need activities which increase our feelings of self-worth and positivity. For many people being in nature and physical exercise bring about these feelings. They lower mental tension, raise energy levels and increase endorphin levels in the brain. The result is an increase in happiness.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>-qtie3066<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>This quote is by Dalai Lama XIV from one of his many writings.</p><p>The big idea here is understand that we really need to focus on being happy from an internal loci of control.</p><p>Here’s how this applies to us and self-improvement:</p><p>They say happiness is a pursuit and not a destination. That is correct.</p><p>They say we should strive for joy on a day to day basis and not suffer on a daily basis with the expectation that one day you will be happy. That is also correct.</p><p>But attaining that state of joy or happiness or whatever you want to call it, is your responsibility. You have to be accountable for it. You cannot let happiness come to you.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>From the very core of our being, we desire contentment. ... Since we are not solely material creatures, it is a mistake to place all our hopes for happiness on external development alone</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The key is to develop inner peace.”</p><p>We all have bad times that's ruining our entire day and it is true. Life is short. It's not okay to spend your time in grief and sorrow or even madness to other people. We just need to appreciate life and be thankful that we're still here breathing above the ground. We shouldn't let our rage rule us for so long because it will just lead to impulsiveness and wrong life decisions.

                            12. “Grow and Be Like the Molave” Manuel L. Quezon Manuel L. Quezon was the first President of the Philippines. He was a member of the Philippine Assembly in 1907 to 1909, resident commissioner to the US Congress in 1909-1916, and president of the Philippine Senate in 1916-1935. He was elected president on September 17, 1935. As president of the land, Quezon worked hard for the independence of our country, the development of the people and for a national language. National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave, industrious, self- reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbued with sound patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from trials and bitter strife of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind. The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights. The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among men. It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly they should be: morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited. I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength. We are Orientals. Orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. In the world of humanity, we look upon a quiet lake from which adventures and enterprising may reap enjoyment and gain. I refuse to allow Filipinos to be so regarded. We shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. Through self-discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace. 1.	What is the basis of national strength, according to the essay? Do you agree? Explain your answer. 2.	What are the peaks, valleys and deep chasms which could hinder the upward climb of mankind? 3.	What does the author want the Filipino to be? Can this goal be achieved? 4.	What values must we possess to be able to achieve the author’s perceived goal for us?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. According to the essay, the basis of national strength is the character of its citizenry. The author believes that a nation cannot be stronger than its parts, and its weakness is its failings, while its strength is its power. I partially agree with this statement because the citizenry's character is a crucial factor in a nation's strength, but it is not the only one. Factors such as the government, economy, and social structures contribute to a nation's strength.</p><p></p><p>2. The peaks, valleys, and deep chasms that could hinder the upward climb of humanity are the obstacles that prevent people from realizing their full potential, such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, corruption, and conflicts. These obstacles hinder progress and development, requiring potent social upheavals.</p><p></p><p>3. The author wants the Filipinos to be solid and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning, or the storm, and confident of their strength. The author also wants the Filipino to be morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited, and imbued with good patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness. I believe this goal can be achieved with proper education, training, and social support.</p><p></p><p>4. To achieve the author's perceived goal, we must possess self-discipline, courage, industry, self-reliance, purposefulness, patriotism, social ideals, and solid moral fibers. These values will enable us to develop our resources, advance our culture, promote social justice, and secure happiness and contentment for all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace.</p><br />

One sunny day, my little puppy jumped onto our red couch and played with his new toy. I liked to watch him play and it made me feel happy? Soon my playful puppy yawned. He was a tired puppy. I picked him up and laid him on his soft, round bed. Soon, my sleepy puppy was snoring away. _______________________________________ Chilled strawberry ice cream is an amazing treat. It is very creamy and has a very smooth texture. Pineapple slices make it colorful. Strawberries add bright and red color too. It also makes an ice cream taste wonderful. White soft cream is added to make the dessert look beautiful. The ice cream is served with crispy biscuit to make it tastes more delicious. _______________________________________ Seashells belong to mollusca or mollusks. There are more than 100,000 kinds of mollusks living in the sea for about 500 million years now. There are many classifications of mollusks. Two of these are being single-shelled and two-shelled. Single-shelled mollusks crawl using their muscle that acts as their foot. Their shells are usually spiraling. Two-shelled mollusks have two valves joining by hinges. These open and close the valves of the shell. _______________________________________ The warm weather allows me to play outside. I play under the sprinkler with my younger brother. We run through the cold water and scream each time! At night, I play hide and seek with my good friends. I usually hide in a big bush; I love it when the weather is warm! _______________________________________ Dogs are domesticated animals that have been living with humans with generations. Dogs can be classified in several different ways. They can be classified by breed. Examples include beagles, basset hounds, poodles and countless others are defined by the American Kennel Club (AKC). They can also be classified by their role in the lives of their masters and the work they do. For example, a dog might be a family pet, a working dog, a show dog, or a hunting dog. In many cases, dogs are defined both by their breed and their roll. For example, a dog could be a beagle that is a family pet. ​</h2><br />

GROW AND BE LIKE THE MOLAVE
by Manuel Luis quezon
National strength can only be built on character. A nation is nothing more or less than its citizenry. It
is the people that make up a nation and, therefore a nation cannot be stronger than its component
parts. Their weakness is its failings, their strength its power. Show me a people composed of
vigorous, sturdy individuals of men and women healthy in mind and body, courteous, brave,
industrious, self-reliant, and purposeful in thoughts as well as in actions, imbeud with sound
patriotism and a profound sense of righteousness, with high social ideals and strong moral fibers-and
I will show you a great nation that will not be submerged. A nation that will emerge victorious from
trials and bitter strifes of a destructed world. A nation that will live forever, sharing the common task
and advancing the welfare and promoting the happiness of mankind.
The upward climb of mankind has been universal. In the human landscape, there are peaks and
valleys, and deep chasms. Generally, there is a need for potent social upheavals, volcanic in
proportions, to raise the lower levels to grow at heights.
The battle for existence and the survival of the fittest has ever the rule of life, in nature and among
men.
It is a heroic task to awaken and apply these faculties so that our people should become what rightly
they should be morally virile, refined, persevering, public-spirited.
I want our people to grow and be like the molave, strong and resilient, unafraid of the raging flood,
the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength.
we are orientals. orientals are known for their passivity and placidity. in the world of humanity, we look upon a quit lake from which adventures and enteprising may reap enjoyment and gain. i refuse to allow filipinos to be so regarded.
we shall be a flowing stream, a rippling brook, a deep and roaring torrent full of life, of hope, of faith and of strength. through self discipline, we shall harness all our energies so that our power spreading over the length and breadth of this land will develop its resources, advance its culture, promote social justice and secure happiness and contentment to all the people under the aegis of liberty and peace.

Through the guidance of our family, friends and mentors, may we answer God’s call to be a sacrament of God’s love to others. Pope Francis always reminds us that, “vocations are born in prayer and from prayer; and only in prayer can they persevere and bear fruit.”

                            26. E. ASSESSMENT Read the selection below and make a summary of it, The Functions of Emotions Imagine what it would be like if we didn't experience emotion--no depths of despair, no depression, no remorse, but at the same time no happiness, joy, or love. Obviously, life would be considerably less satisfying, and even dull, if we lacked the capacity to sense and express emotion. But do emotions serve any purpose beyond making life interesting? Indeed, they do. Psychologists have identified several important functions that emotions play in our daily lives. Emotions prepare us for action. Emotions act as a link between events in our environment and our responses. For example, if we saw an angry dog charging toward us, the emotional reaction (fear) would be associated with the activation of the "fighter-flight" response. This prepares us for emergency action, which presumably would get us out of the dog's way-quickly. Emotions shape our future behavior. Emotions promote learning that will help us make appropriate responses in the future. For example, the emotional response that occurs when we experience something unpleasant-such as a threatening dog- teaches us to avoid similar circumstances in the future. In the same way, pleasant emotions act as positive reinforcement for prior behavior and therefore may lead an individual to seek similar situations in the future. Emotions help us interact more effectively with others. We often communicate the emotions we experience through our verbal and nonverbal behaviors, making our emotions obvious to observers.
