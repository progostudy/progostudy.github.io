"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that the days and years go by while
I am living with a, living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive

If given a chance I would go back to me childhood years I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on ou faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow. Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being a child also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily. Without a doubt, childhood will always be the best so much glee and serenity Questions 1. What is the sentence that shows how the author feel about the topic? 2.

I'm sorry to interrupt you Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name. But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although you have indeed been called.
You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach.
But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends.
And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well, I am nearby.
This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors: Be still and give up your spirits, they don't belong to you.
For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.
My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you.
I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now.
It's time to rest. For you, and for those you have carried in your arms.
This ends for all of us.

Answer the questions in your notebook.Trip Down Memory Lane Sarah Bianca V. SaritaHow would you feel if you're a young child again? No pile of homework, problem, and heartache. Everything just seems bright and perfect. If given a chance, I would go back to my childhood years.I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on our faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony, indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise, the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment. I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow.Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents, especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being achild also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily.

Instead, write,"To my best self" or "To my one true love" or evenuse your nickname like, "Dear lovable ________."· Start off by saying why you are writing the letter. Itcould be something like, "I feel so full of love for you today that I justhad to express my feelings." Or, It is unique, just like my love foryourself."· This is where you describe yourself and how you feelabout being you. It's important too. If you are someone who is sentimentaland flowery, then your letter should be, too. But if you're more of a funnyperson, don't be afraid to add a little humor or silliness here. These shouldbe your words and your voice, speaking from the heart. Recognize your presentsituation and talk about it. Recognize your strengths and be thankful. Embraceyour uniqueness and giftedness. Be honest of what you feel.· In the last paragraph, you want to both tie back to thebeginning and look to the future. You might say, "It's hard for me toexpress everything I am feeling right now; these words are only a small measureof my love for you. So I am thankful that I _____________ how much I loveyou." Or, if you started by writing about the uniqueness of your life, Iam so glad that you are my _______________(referring yourself).

                                            Task 1 Directions: Read and analyze the short persuasive essay example below. Answer the questions Trip Down Memory Lane Sarah Bianca V. Sarita How would you feel if you're a young child again? No pile of homework, problem, and heartache. Everything just seems bright and perfect. If given a chance, I would go back to my childhood years. I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on our faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony, indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise, the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment. I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow. Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents, especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being a child also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily. Without a doubt, childhood will always be the best; so much glee and serenity 1.

                         Analyze the song entitled "Leaves" by Ben and Ben<p></p><p><strong>How can you appreciate the poem as you listen to it?</strong></p><p>- <strong>The beat of the poem even without music is easy to follow</strong>, and when arranged musically, it is very pleasing to the ears and can definitely stick in one's head. Apart from semantic value, the poem also imparts a beautiful lesson and sticks to the metaphors for healing, making the whole cohesive.</p><p></p><p><strong>What thoughts, ideas or feelings of the poet can you infer from the poem?</strong></p><p>- The poet can be inferred as a hopeful person trying to look at tomorrow as a time for healed wounds. <strong>He made many mistakes, but someone was always </strong>there to encourage him. Throughout the end of the song, it was his turn to encourage the person with him to keep holding on ("I said everything will be alright in time"). There is deep sadness and pain within the poet, but there is an undeniable seed of hope that tomorrow is another day, and that, just as leaves grow from the empty branches of trees, new life will stem from the dead memories of the past.</p><p></p><p><strong>What emotions or thoughts run through your mind as you listen to this poem?</strong></p><p>- Listening to this song, with the way each line is dropped, I come to share the poet's point of view. They are wounded and imperfect and need to see the bright side no matter how difficult it is. <strong>Eventually, though, it feels less like I am the poet, and more like the poet</strong> is speaking to me--as the song nears the end, the seed of hope is planted in the person the poet is speaking to. It's a heartwarming poem that serves as a reminder that wounds heal if you give it time. "Learning to forgive," then, isn't just about forgiving those who've wronged you--it's also about forgiving yourself, and moving on.</p><p></p><p></p><p>More about the song called "Leaf" by Ben and Ben</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/8604391</p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Situation 1.
</p><p>Jeff and his friends are at the mall. Some guys from another high school that jeff and his friends don't like are there. Some of jeff's friends want to get into it with these other guys. One of the guys from the other high school is dating Jeff's ex-girlfriend-Jeff doesn't really like that, but he's not sure whether he wants to get into a fight.
</p><p>
</p><p>Question:
</p><p>WHAT ARE JEFF'S OPTIONS AND WHAT SHOULD HE DO?
</p><p>Answer: I think Jeff should make a wiser decision by not doing things that would result to fighting. If they can avoid any problem then they should try to. Since his ex-girlfriend is already hi ex- he should not interfere unless needed.
</p><p>
</p><p>Situation 2.
</p><p>Ana has been feeling depressed lately.Nothing seems to be going right in her life.She is always fighting with her mom, her boyfriend is treating her bad and she thinks he is going to break up with her, she doesn't have any close girlfriends to talk to, and her grades at school have been slipping.Ana is starting to think that killing herself might be the answer.
</p><p>
</p><p>Question:
</p><p>WHAT ARE ANA'S OPTIONS AND WHAT SHOULD SHE DO?
</p><p>Answer:  Ana has the option to stay alive and try fixing things and opening herself more or end her life. For me, it’s the best for Ana to talk with her mother how she feels. I also think that she needs to end her current relationship because it is toxic already and it is also jeopardizing her life.
</p><p>
</p><p>Situation 3.
</p><p>Gie has been smoking a little weed her friends lately and likes getting high.Her parents have no idea what she is doing, its fun, and so far everything is going fine with school and in her social life.This weekend she and some friends are going to a party where there will be plenty of weed and, she has heard there will be crack there too.She is trying to decide if she will try some.Just trying it once is no big deal-right?
</p><p>
</p><p>Question:
</p><p>WHAT ARE GIE'S OPTIONS AND WHAT SHOULD SHE DO?
</p><p>Answer: Her options are to try, not to go to the party and try. For me, it’s best if she won’t try at all because once tried, you might want to do it again which can resort to habitual doing.
</p><p>
</p><p>Situation 4.
</p><p>Jen's friends try to talk monica into going with them to get a tattoo.Monica's friends say it will be cool;everyone in the group can get a tatto.Monica is considering it, but is concerned about her parents'reaction and whether she really wants a tattoo.She does like the idea of doing something that connects her with her friends.
</p><p>
</p><p>Question:
</p><p>WHAT ARE MONICA'S OPTION AND WHAT SHOULD SHE DO?
</p><p>Answer: Ask permission from her parents or constructively reject her friends idea. I think she should ask her parents’ permission first because if a problem can be prevented, then why not do it. By asking permission from your parents you are also showing that they have  a say to you decisions and that you respect their views.

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that the days and years go by while
I am living with a, living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive

Do you still remember when there was always a smile on ou faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow. Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being a child also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily. Without a doubt, childhood will always be the best so much glee and serenity Questions 1. What is the sentence that shows how the author feel about the topic? 2.

"Honestly"
by Harem Scarem
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive
You don't have to say it, I don't have to read your mind
To know that emptiness has finally arrived
How was I to know right from wrong
Words were hardly spoken, so where did I go wrong
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Words have more meaning, if they're said at certain times
I need you now so I can feel alive
How would you know if you won't give me some time
To see if everything could work out you'll be mine
I'll be lost forever or someday I may find
The words that I've been searching for or just some peace of mind
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
All the nights I sit and wonder there must be more to life
I'm sure that days and years go by while
I am living with a living with a lonely feeling
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
Tell me honestly, if you're still loving me
Looking into my eyes honestly
I stand before you accused of many crimes
But I want to believe that love can still survive</h2><br />

You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach.
But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends.
And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well, I am nearby.
This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors: Be still and give up your spirits, they don't belong to you.
For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.
My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you.
I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now.
It's time to rest. For you, and for those you have carried in your arms.
This ends for all of us.
End communication.</h2><br />

                            22. Learning Task 1Directions: Read and analyze the short persuasive essay example below. Answer the questions in your notebook.Trip Down Memory Lane Sarah Bianca V. SaritaHow would you feel if you're a young child again? No pile of homework, problem, and heartache. Everything just seems bright and perfect. If given a chance, I would go back to my childhood years.I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on our faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony, indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise, the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment. I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow.Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents, especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being achild also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily. Without a doubt, childhood will always be the best; so much glee and serenity.Questions:What is the sentence that shows how the author feel about the topic? 2.

                            23. Write a letter of love and appreciation. Thanking oneselffor being unique and for the gifts you've received-talents, skills, etc. (Youmay also do a video, like in the example shown in the material, or just simply writing a letter-the choice is yours)Here are tips and ideas:· Don't just write "Dear self." Instead, write,"To my best self" or "To my one true love" or evenuse your nickname like, "Dear lovable ________."· Start off by saying why you are writing the letter. Itcould be something like, "I feel so full of love for you today that I justhad to express my feelings." Or, It is unique, just like my love foryourself."· This is where you describe yourself and how you feelabout being you. It's important too. If you are someone who is sentimentaland flowery, then your letter should be, too. But if you're more of a funnyperson, don't be afraid to add a little humor or silliness here. These shouldbe your words and your voice, speaking from the heart. Recognize your presentsituation and talk about it. Recognize your strengths and be thankful. Embraceyour uniqueness and giftedness. Be honest of what you feel.· In the last paragraph, you want to both tie back to thebeginning and look to the future. You might say, "It's hard for me toexpress everything I am feeling right now; these words are only a small measureof my love for you. So I am thankful that I _____________ how much I loveyou." Or, if you started by writing about the uniqueness of your life, Iam so glad that you are my _______________(referring yourself).
