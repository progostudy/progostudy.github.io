                                            Below is an example of a Feature Article. Read, understand, then answer the questions Welcome to the now normal By: Ar. Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.    When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era.     Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.    The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

                                            an amazing place in Japan. Artificial Beaches, Anyone? Although Japan is surrounded by sea, the waters are not great for swimming. They are too cold to be enjoyed most of the year. They are dangerous not only because of the strong undercurrents but also because of big sharks. But Japan has come up with a high-tech solution. It has produced artificial beaches inside very big domes. Yes, artificial beaches complete with rocks, sand, palm trees, waters at right temperature, and even waves. One such artificial beach is the Ocean Dome of Phoenix Seagaia Resort which opened in 1993. Located in Miyazaki City on Kyushu Island, it is the world's biggest indoor water park. The scene inside the dome is like a Caribbean Island with realistic (beaches, palm trees, rocks, waves, and sand. The sand is actually very finely crushed marble. There is an equipment that produces artificial waves and another that creates day or evening scenes when necessary. Another indoor water park was the Wild Blue Yokohama which opened in June 1992. It looked very natural with its own original system of generating continuous waves. It had more of a tropical atmosphere. Young people gathered here to enjoy summer even in winter. But can these artificial beaches be better than the real ones? What do all these mean to us, Filipinos? For one thing, these remind us how lucky and blessed we are. We have been endowed by God with many fascinating beaches. Let us take very good care of our beaches because if they lose their natural beauty, we may be forced to import another product from Japan-artificial beaches! Heaven forbid! Think It Over I. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. Source: Money-Saver Magazine, April 1994 How are the seas surrounding Japan described in the selection? How did Japan solve its problem with its beaches? What is the world's biggest indoor water park? Where is it located? Where do young people in Japan gather to have fun during summer or even in winter? What is the scene inside the Dome of Miyazaki like? What do all these man-made beaches remind us Filipinos? What does the article aim to tell us? What may happen if we do not care for our beaches? ​</a>

                                            "Plato's Allegory of the Cave"Some prisoners are chained inside of a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see (and hear) are shadows passing back and forth (and the echoes bouncing off of) the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside of the cave. He is blinded by the light, and confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see the things around him, and even the sun itself. He comes to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others—only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness) and violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and even try to kill him).Question:1. What are the objects, symbols use in the plato's allegory of the cave?2. How does this passage from plato help you turn your attention toward the right thing (i.e. truth, beauty, justice &amp; goodness? )3. Give the interpretations and meaning of each symbols in relation to real life?​Help po please!</a>

                                            Below is an example of a Feature Article. Read, understand, then answer the questions Welcome to the now normal By: Ar. Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience. A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience. A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era. Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

                                            Instruction: Congratulations for making it this far! You’re almost done. Before you proceed to your next lesson, let us test your mastery. Today’s task is to read the following paragraphs and determine which pattern of development in writing is used. Are you ready? Here are the paragraphs. 1. Caring for yourself during these times is also caring for others. When we are allowed to go outside our houses, we should obey health practices. Some are skeptic about wearing masks. Others are still in doubt when asked to wash hands often or use alcohol and sanitizer. There are also people who question the need to maintain distance from each other in public areas. These safety measures are set because they are proven to be helpful in preventing the spread of the virus. They are not mere wishes to make our lives difficult. We are asked to do these health protocols because we are still in danger with the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Be responsible for yourself so that you will not be the reason for others to catch the virus. If you care for your loved ones, you must take care of yourself first. You do not want to be the one bringing the virus to your home. 2. The word quarantine is such a familiar one to almost everyone who are aware of the pandemic today. According to the Merriam- Webster dictionary online, it is a noun that has several meanings. It states that it is a period of 40 days. It may also be a term during which a ship arriving in port and suspected of carrying contagious disease is held in isolation from the shore. Also, it means a restraint upon the activities or communication of persons or the transport of goods designed to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is also defined as a state of enforced isolation. For us, who have been in community quarantine for more or less three months, we know that quarantine means staying at home and waiting for the situation to be better. It is a condition wherein only those who have quarantine pass are allowed to go out for essential needs of the family. For others, the concept quarantine may also be equated to “no work, no pay” policy. Some may define it as something needed for people who are sick or those who came from places with COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, some probably sees quarantine as something that takes away their right to see family, relatives and friends. To sum it up, whatever or however we understand quarantine, we need to follow it as a safety protocol since we are still fighting this pandemic. 3. There are several similarities and differences between being a senior and junior high school student. Being a senior and junior high school student, both require you to study hard to be able to get desirable outputs and decent grades. Subjects are equally important to be given attention. It’s just that some subject areas may be easier to deal with depending on different factors. The subjects in senior high school (SHS) and junior high school (JHS) differ in a way that SHS subjects are more specific areas that are deemed essential for the track and strand you chose while in JHS, subjects are the general ones that we have since first grade, just increasing in complexity. Another similarity is that when you enter SHS and JHS, you have to prepare yourself to be a responsible part of the institution that you will enroll in. You should be ready to follow the policy that the school implements. Being a “senior” high student doesn’t mean you are superior or anything and being a “junior” high student doesn’t mean that you are under those in the SHS. The difference comes when there may be slight changes in the way rules and regulations are applied and the gravity of reprimands you may receive as you step up to higher grade levels or as you encounter different situations. In general, whether there are similarity or difference in being a Senior or Junior high school student, it’s is still up to you how you will handle it.​</a>

How do we navigate through the uncertainties posed by our time? The simple truth is that there are no ready-made answers for this question. None of us have gone through ma before. No one realy 100-percent ready for what comes next What I can say, however, is that I myself have gone through periods of uncertainty And my experiences have taught me to be at peace with the act of stepping into the unknown by anchoring mysed on two things looking outward and moving forward Look beyond ourselves names of cra, many will feel the urge to think only of ones to founder, and o retreat in cur anal comes of comfort.

The conception of education and of what an educated man is varies in response to fundamental changes in the details and aims of society. In our country and during this transition stage in our national life, what are the qualities which an educated man should possess? Great changes have takes place in the nature of our social life during the last forty years. The contact with the Americans and their civilization has modified many of our old customs, traditions and practices, some for the worse and many for the better. The means of communication have improved and therefore better understanding exists among the different sections of our country. Religious freedom has developed religious tolerance in our people. The growth of public schools and establishment of democratic institutions have developed our national consciousness both in strength and in solidarity. With this growth in national consciousness and national spirit among our people, we witness the corresponding rise of a new conception in education- the training of an individual for the duties and privileges of citizenship, not only for his own happiness and efficiency but also for national service and welfare. In the old days, education was a matter of private concern; now it is a public function, and the State not only has the duty but it has the right as well to educate every member of the community- the old as well as the young, women as well as non- not only for the good of the individual but also for the self-preservation and self protection of the State itself. Our modern public school system has been established as a safeguard against the shortcomings and dangers of the demoustic governinent and democratic institutions. In the light of the social changes, we come again to the question: What qualities should distinguish the educated Filipino today? I venture to suggest that the educated Filipino should, first, be distinguished by the power to DO! The Oriental excels in reflective thinking; he is a philosopher. The Occidental is a doer; he manages things, men and affairs The Filipino of today needs more of his power to translate reflection into action. I belleve that we are coming more and more to the conviction that no Filipino has the right to be considered educated unless he is prepared and ready to take un active and useful part of the work, life, and progress of our country as well as in the progress of the world."​</a>

 Stone Soup
A kindly, old stranger was walking through the land when he came upon a village. As he entered, the villagers moved towards their homes locking doors and windows.
The stranger smiled and asked, why are you all so frightened. I am a simple traveler, looking for a soft place to stay for the night and a warm place for a meal.
"There's not a bite to eat in the whole province," he was told. "We are weak and our children are starving. Better keep moving on."
"Oh, I have everything I need," he said. "In fact, I was thinking of making some stone soup to share with all of you." He pulled an iron cauldron from his cloak, filled it with water, and began to build a fire under it.
Then, with great ceremony, he drew an ordinary-looking stone from a silken bag and dropped it into the water.
By now, hearing the rumor of food, most of the villagers had come out of their homes or watched from their windows. As the stranger sniffed the "broth" and licked his lips in anticipation, hunger began to overcome their fear.
"Ahh," the stranger said to himself rather loudly, "I do like a tasty stone soup. Of course, stone soup with cabbage -- that's hard to beat."
Soon a villager approached hesitantly, holding a small cabbage he'd retrieved from its hiding place, and added it to the pot.
"Wonderful!!" cried the stranger. "You know, I once had stone soup with cabbage and a bit of salt beef as well, and it was fit for a king."
The village butcher managed to find some salt beef . . . And so it went, through potatoes, onions, carrots, mushrooms, and so on, until there was indeed a delicious meal for everyone in the village to share.
The villager elder offered the stranger a great deal of money for the magic stone, but he refused to sell it and traveled on the next day.
As he left, the stranger came upon a group of village children standing near the road. He gave the silken bag containing the stone to the youngest child, whispering to a group, "It was not the stone, but the villagers that had performed the magic."

One, two! And through and throughThe vorpal blade went snicker - snack!He left it dead, and with its headHe went galumphing back.“And has thou slain the Jabberwock?Come to my arms, my beamish boy!O frabjous day!

The day had been hot, but now, with the dusk falling, a pleasant breezehad sprung up and was coming in from the courtyard, along the corridor, and into his cell. The old prison was very much like theones in cowboy movies. The door of his cell, as well as the one at the end of the corridor were steel frames with iron bars less thantwenty centimetres apart; too close for even the thinnest man to squeeze through, but ample for a cat. One could see through thebars, talk with the guards and the prisoners in the other cells, and be disturbed by someone snoring at night, and the barred doorsmade the prison airy.It was much better than the foreign prisons he had read about, with solid doors, peepholes, and electric bulbs burning thewhole night long. Although the local revolution modelled itself on the Russian one to some extent, it did not have the means toimitate Lubyanka. The revolution was also milder in other respects. A political prisoner usually had done something against theregime, be it only grumbling in public. The interrogations were mostly carried out without torture. Although no public or journalistswere admitted to the more serious political trials, the prisoner had the right to defend himself, and, in case of a death sentence -these, unfortunately, were rather common and mostly undeserved - the condemned man had the right to appeal to the President,although in most cases it only delayed the execution by a few days.The prisoner finished his cigarette, put it out in an empty sardine tin which served him as ashtray, sat on his bed, and lookedat the door again. The spaces between the bars were fine, even for the largest cat to pass through, and the door at the end of thecorridor was the same. In the small rectangular cobbled courtyard where they took their daily walks and where they shot condemnedprisoners at dawn, a couple of skinny young trees, hardly more than saplings, grew by the wall on the right, a few of the thinbranches reaching the top of the wall, nothing to support a man, but good enough for a cat. It was not the wall where they shotpeople; that one was opposite it, at right angle to the door. On days following an execution, of which they had heard every wordand shot through the barred doors, walking in a circle during their daily exercise, they would look furtively for traces of blood on​</a>

                                            "Plato's Allegory of the Cave"Some prisoners are chained inside of a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see (and hear) are shadows passing back and forth (and the echoes bouncing off of) the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside of the cave. He is blinded by the light, and confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see the things around him, and even the sun itself. He comes to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others—only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness) and violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and even try to kill him).Question:1. What are the objects, symbols use in the plato's allegory of the cave?2. How does this passage from plato help you turn your attention toward the right thing (i.e. truth, beauty, justice &amp; goodness? )3. Give the interpretations and meaning of each symbols in relation to real life?​Help po please!​</a>

There were just so many opportunities lost because I justcould not get what was before me - how I should react to it or deal with it.But growing up helped with coping. Even when an interaction is just a pile of your actions shattering into"Huh?" or "What?" or that other person's stare of bewilderment with matching eyebrows raised the best wayto deal with it is to not dwell on it too much.You are doing fine even when you are all over the place, because the mistakes you earn and the memories ofembarrassments past help in some way to try again and get it right with the right person.[...] And what growing up taught me most is that people come and go; what matters is the memories you hadwith them when they stayed You are the constant in this coming and going, so what will always matter is thatyou become a better person than yourself, and that you find mearing in all this clumsy struggling.

                            1. .“It’s utterly impossible for me to build my life on a foundation of chaos, suffering and death. I see the world being slowly transformed into a wilderness, I hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too, I feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow feel that everything will change for the better that this cruelty too will end, that peace and tranquility will return once more. In the meantime, I must hold on to my ideals. Perhaps the day will come when I’ll be able to realize them. 1.What is the atmosphere of the text? 2. What is the tone of the writer? 3. Cite some figurative language used by the writer and explain its meaning.4. What is the theme of the text?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The atmosphere of the text is one of despair and hopelessness, as the writer describes the world as being transformed into a wilderness and approaching destruction.</p><p>The tone of the writer is one of melancholy and introspection, as they reflect on the suffering of millions and hold on to their ideals despite the seeming impossibility of achieving them.</p><p>The writer uses figurative language to convey their emotions and views about the world. For example, the approaching thunder is a metaphor for the impending destruction that the writer sees on the horizon. The transformation of the world into a wilderness is also a metaphor for the destruction of nature and the loss of human values. Finally, the writer's feeling that everything will change for the better is a form of hope, represented through the figurative language of looking up at the sky.</p><p>The theme of the text is one of hope and perseverance in the face of overwhelming despair. The writer acknowledges the suffering and chaos of the world, but refuses to give up on their ideals and beliefs in a better future. The text highlights the power of hope and the importance of holding onto one's values, even in the darkest of times.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) The atmosphere of the text is one of despair and hope. The writer acknowledges the chaos and suffering in the world but also holds onto hope for a better future.</p><p>2.) The tone of the writer is reflective and contemplative. The writer is thoughtful and introspective as they consider the state of the world and their own ideals.</p><p>3.) The writer uses figurative language such as "the world being slowly transformed into a wilderness" and "the approaching thunder" to convey the sense of impending doom and destruction. These metaphors suggest that the writer sees the world as a dangerous and inhospitable place. The phrase "hold on to my ideals" is also figurative language that suggests the writer is grasping onto something intangible in the face of difficult circumstances.</p><p>4.)

Vittoria Mawis-AlistoWhen the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A year later, however, the war against the deadly disease continues. It has become evident that curbing the pandemic is taking longer than expected. When the fight against COVID-19 started a year ago, many businesses and activities had to stop operations to contain the spread of the virus. Back then, a lot of us saw the event as a temporary inconvenience.     A new term has been coined to describe our current situation of unpredictability—the “now normal.” This is a period when we live day to day, not knowing what to expect tomorrow. While the uncertainty might scare us, it is also an opportunity for us to improve our lives for the better.    When it comes to real estate, the now normal has definitely seen changes. Developers have come up with innovative ways to keep businesses running and units selling. Here are some revolutionary ideas in the now normal that show us that despite today’s challenges, we can still pursue our dream properties. When it comes to multi-family dwellings, contactless technologies have become prized assets. Many developers added smart home features in their condominium projects to lessen the need for touching objects and consequently the chance of transmitting pathogens. Open spaces, green features and daylighting solutions have also been highlighted in upcoming projects. These elements are thought to promote health and wellness, deemed as prized elements in the pandemic era.     Nowadays, it pays to be a techie. From Zoom conferences to video walkthroughs, various technological advancements enable us to connect with people without having to leave our homes. In the world of real estate, online presentations, digital walkthroughs and virtual consultations have become the norm. Webinars and recorded presentations teach us new things, from decorating our homes to creating virus-free, domestic spaces. These strategies have actually improved our means of communication with agents and developers. Compared to pre-pandemic times, we can say that the world of real estate has become more interconnected and accessible today.    The now normal challenges developers to implement radical solutions to solve unprecedented problems. While it is certainly a bummer that the COVID-19 pandemic remains present in our midst, this misfortune has enabled us to re-examine our priorities and make some changes. The real estate industry, in particular, has seen numerous improvements in its services and offerings. Despite the challenges, the now normal has certainly pushed us to aim for a better future. While it may take some time before we can fully resume our regular lifestyles, the changes that we’ve seen in this era certainly improve our way of living. Let us hope that with these innovations, we will be able to finally overcome the spread of the COVID-19 disease.*What kind of feature story do you think is “Welcome to the now normal”?

They are too cold to be enjoyed most of the year. They are dangerous not only because of the strong undercurrents but also because of big sharks. But Japan has come up with a high-tech solution. It has produced artificial beaches inside very big domes. Yes, artificial beaches complete with rocks, sand, palm trees, waters at right temperature, and even waves. One such artificial beach is the Ocean Dome of Phoenix Seagaia Resort which opened in 1993. Located in Miyazaki City on Kyushu Island, it is the world's biggest indoor water park. The scene inside the dome is like a Caribbean Island with realistic (beaches, palm trees, rocks, waves, and sand. The sand is actually very finely crushed marble. There is an equipment that produces artificial waves and another that creates day or evening scenes when necessary. Another indoor water park was the Wild Blue Yokohama which opened in June 1992. It looked very natural with its own original system of generating continuous waves. It had more of a tropical atmosphere. Young people gathered here to enjoy summer even in winter. But can these artificial beaches be better than the real ones? What do all these mean to us, Filipinos? For one thing, these remind us how lucky and blessed we are. We have been endowed by God with many fascinating beaches. Let us take very good care of our beaches because if they lose their natural beauty, we may be forced to import another product from Japan-artificial beaches! Heaven forbid!

                            13. "Plato's Allegory of the Cave"Some prisoners are chained inside of a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see (and hear) are shadows passing back and forth (and the echoes bouncing off of) the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside of the cave. He is blinded by the light, and confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see the things around him, and even the sun itself. He comes to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others—only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness) and violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and even try to kill him).Question:1. What are the objects, symbols use in the plato's allegory of the cave?2.

Caring for yourself during these times is also caring for others. When we are allowed to go outside our houses, we should obey health practices. Some are skeptic about wearing masks. Others are still in doubt when asked to wash hands often or use alcohol and sanitizer. There are also people who question the need to maintain distance from each other in public areas. These safety measures are set because they are proven to be helpful in preventing the spread of the virus. They are not mere wishes to make our lives difficult. We are asked to do these health protocols because we are still in danger with the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Be responsible for yourself so that you will not be the reason for others to catch the virus. If you care for your loved ones, you must take care of yourself first. You do not want to be the one bringing the virus to your home. 2. The word quarantine is such a familiar one to almost everyone who are aware of the pandemic today. According to the Merriam- Webster dictionary online, it is a noun that has several meanings. It states that it is a period of 40 days. It may also be a term during which a ship arriving in port and suspected of carrying contagious disease is held in isolation from the shore. Also, it means a restraint upon the activities or communication of persons or the transport of goods designed to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is also defined as a state of enforced isolation. For us, who have been in community quarantine for more or less three months, we know that quarantine means staying at home and waiting for the situation to be better. It is a condition wherein only those who have quarantine pass are allowed to go out for essential needs of the family. For others, the concept quarantine may also be equated to “no work, no pay” policy. Some may define it as something needed for people who are sick or those who came from places with COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, some probably sees quarantine as something that takes away their right to see family, relatives and friends. To sum it up, whatever or however we understand quarantine, we need to follow it as a safety protocol since we are still fighting this pandemic. 3. There are several similarities and differences between being a senior and junior high school student. Being a senior and junior high school student, both require you to study hard to be able to get desirable outputs and decent grades. Subjects are equally important to be given attention. It’s just that some subject areas may be easier to deal with depending on different factors. The subjects in senior high school (SHS) and junior high school (JHS) differ in a way that SHS subjects are more specific areas that are deemed essential for the track and strand you chose while in JHS, subjects are the general ones that we have since first grade, just increasing in complexity. Another similarity is that when you enter SHS and JHS, you have to prepare yourself to be a responsible part of the institution that you will enroll in. You should be ready to follow the policy that the school implements. Being a “senior” high student doesn’t mean you are superior or anything and being a “junior” high student doesn’t mean that you are under those in the SHS. The difference comes when there may be slight changes in the way rules and regulations are applied and the gravity of reprimands you may receive as you step up to higher grade levels or as you encounter different situations. In general, whether there are similarity or difference in being a Senior or Junior high school student, it’s is still up to you how you will handle it.​</h2><br />

The conception of education and of what an educated man is varies in response to fundamental changes in the details and aims of society. In our country and during this transition stage in our national life, what are the qualities which an educated man should possess? Great changes have takes place in the nature of our social life during the last forty years. The contact with the Americans and their civilization has modified many of our old customs, traditions and practices, some for the worse and many for the better. The means of communication have improved and therefore better understanding exists among the different sections of our country. Religious freedom has developed religious tolerance in our people. The growth of public schools and establishment of democratic institutions have developed our national consciousness both in strength and in solidarity. With this growth in national consciousness and national spirit among our people, we witness the corresponding rise of a new conception in education- the training of an individual for the duties and privileges of citizenship, not only for his own happiness and efficiency but also for national service and welfare. In the old days, education was a matter of private concern; now it is a public function, and the State not only has the duty but it has the right as well to educate every member of the community- the old as well as the young, women as well as non- not only for the good of the individual but also for the self-preservation and self protection of the State itself. Our modern public school system has been established as a safeguard against the shortcomings and dangers of the demoustic governinent and democratic institutions. In the light of the social changes, we come again to the question: What qualities should distinguish the educated Filipino today? I venture to suggest that the educated Filipino should, first, be distinguished by the power to DO! The Oriental excels in reflective thinking; he is a philosopher. The Occidental is a doer; he manages things, men and affairs The Filipino of today needs more of his power to translate reflection into action. I belleve that we are coming more and more to the conviction that no Filipino has the right to be considered educated unless he is prepared and ready to take un active and useful part of the work, life, and progress of our country as well as in the progress of the world."​</h2><br />

 Stone Soup
A kindly, old stranger was walking through the land when he came upon a village. As he entered, the villagers moved towards their homes locking doors and windows.
The stranger smiled and asked, why are you all so frightened. I am a simple traveler, looking for a soft place to stay for the night and a warm place for a meal.
"There's not a bite to eat in the whole province," he was told. "We are weak and our children are starving. Better keep moving on."
"Oh, I have everything I need," he said. "In fact, I was thinking of making some stone soup to share with all of you." He pulled an iron cauldron from his cloak, filled it with water, and began to build a fire under it.
Then, with great ceremony, he drew an ordinary-looking stone from a silken bag and dropped it into the water.
By now, hearing the rumor of food, most of the villagers had come out of their homes or watched from their windows. As the stranger sniffed the "broth" and licked his lips in anticipation, hunger began to overcome their fear.
"Ahh," the stranger said to himself rather loudly, "I do like a tasty stone soup. Of course, stone soup with cabbage -- that's hard to beat."
Soon a villager approached hesitantly, holding a small cabbage he'd retrieved from its hiding place, and added it to the pot.
"Wonderful!!" cried the stranger. "You know, I once had stone soup with cabbage and a bit of salt beef as well, and it was fit for a king."
The village butcher managed to find some salt beef . . . And so it went, through potatoes, onions, carrots, mushrooms, and so on, until there was indeed a delicious meal for everyone in the village to share.
The villager elder offered the stranger a great deal of money for the magic stone, but he refused to sell it and traveled on the next day.
As he left, the stranger came upon a group of village children standing near the road. He gave the silken bag containing the stone to the youngest child, whispering to a group, "It was not the stone, but the villagers that had performed the magic."

The day had been hot, but now, with the dusk falling, a pleasant breezehad sprung up and was coming in from the courtyard, along the corridor, and into his cell. The old prison was very much like theones in cowboy movies. The door of his cell, as well as the one at the end of the corridor were steel frames with iron bars less thantwenty centimetres apart; too close for even the thinnest man to squeeze through, but ample for a cat. One could see through thebars, talk with the guards and the prisoners in the other cells, and be disturbed by someone snoring at night, and the barred doorsmade the prison airy.It was much better than the foreign prisons he had read about, with solid doors, peepholes, and electric bulbs burning thewhole night long. Although the local revolution modelled itself on the Russian one to some extent, it did not have the means toimitate Lubyanka. The revolution was also milder in other respects. A political prisoner usually had done something against theregime, be it only grumbling in public. The interrogations were mostly carried out without torture. Although no public or journalistswere admitted to the more serious political trials, the prisoner had the right to defend himself, and, in case of a death sentence -these, unfortunately, were rather common and mostly undeserved - the condemned man had the right to appeal to the President,although in most cases it only delayed the execution by a few days.The prisoner finished his cigarette, put it out in an empty sardine tin which served him as ashtray, sat on his bed, and lookedat the door again. The spaces between the bars were fine, even for the largest cat to pass through, and the door at the end of thecorridor was the same. In the small rectangular cobbled courtyard where they took their daily walks and where they shot condemnedprisoners at dawn, a couple of skinny young trees, hardly more than saplings, grew by the wall on the right, a few of the thinbranches reaching the top of the wall, nothing to support a man, but good enough for a cat.

                            27. "Plato's Allegory of the Cave"Some prisoners are chained inside of a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see (and hear) are shadows passing back and forth (and the echoes bouncing off of) the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside of the cave. He is blinded by the light, and confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see the things around him, and even the sun itself. He comes to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others—only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness) and violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and even try to kill him).Question:1. What are the objects, symbols use in the plato's allegory of the cave?2. How does this passage from plato help you turn your attention toward the right thing (i.e. truth, beauty, justice &amp; goodness? )3. Give the interpretations and meaning of each symbols in relation to real life?​Help po please!​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" is a concept devised by the philosopher to ruminate on the nature of belief versus knowledge. The allegory states that there exists prisoners chained together in a cave. ... The prisoners watch these shadows, believing them to be real. Plato posits that one prisoner could become free</p><p></p><p>Who are the prisoners in the cave? The prisoners represent humans, particularly people who are immersed in the superficial world of appearances. ... In his allegory, Plato discusses a type of prisoner that is freed from their chains. Plato believes that these freed prisoners are the philosophers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In Plato's “Allegory of the Cave”, the cave, chains, and fire are used to demonstrate what prisoners lacked. Within Plato's Allegory the cave, chains, and fire represent the prisoners limitation to knowledge, free will, and truth</p><p></p><p>But the prisoners think that he is dangerous because the information that he tells them is so abstract and opposed to what they know. The prisoners choose not to be free because they are comfortable in their own world of ignorance, and they are hostile to people who want to give them an alternative view of the world.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            28. Life feels like a massive rehearsal for every person you have to talk to, for every situation you have to attend,which just falls apart into wild swings of arrogance and timidity.Growing up didn't help with the awkwardness. There were just so many opportunities lost because I justcould not get what was before me - how I should react to it or deal with it.But growing up helped with coping. Even when an interaction is just a pile of your actions shattering into"Huh?" or "What?" or that other person's stare of bewilderment with matching eyebrows raised the best wayto deal with it is to not dwell on it too much.You are doing fine even when you are all over the place, because the mistakes you earn and the memories ofembarrassments past help in some way to try again and get it right with the right person.[...] And what growing up taught me most is that people come and go; what matters is the memories you hadwith them when they stayed You are the constant in this coming and going, so what will always matter is thatyou become a better person than yourself, and that you find mearing in all this clumsy struggling. You justhave to build value, either through becoming more well-adjusted or just becoming more skilled or justkeeping yourself going through the day.Excerpt from The Awkward Years by Ace Alba+1. in which paragraph expresses the main idea that encounter and engagement with people seems like a trialand error experience?A. paragraph 1B. paragraph 2C. paragraph 4D. paragraph 52.Which statement best summarizes the passage?A Entering adulthood is a time when people charge mistake as learning and deal with all sorts of uneasinessin one's lifeB.
