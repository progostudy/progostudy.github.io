She doesn't have a hometown, and she won't ever have life-long friends. She has never been in one place The fist thing that strikes you about Katherine is her smile. It is by no means a perfect smile it isn't even close. It's how easily that smile comes that makes it so special. A glance from a nearby stranger will earn a broad smile. A smile will get a heartfelt grin, and agrin receives such laughing smiles that most people turn around after they've past and shake their heads with concem. This is a story about saying goodbye and then turning around and saying hello. It's about moving it's about change. It's about daily life in the Air Force. Each move means another house and different friends. Different rules and different cultures A simple smile helps Katherine through this change. Her joy is seeing others feel joy. Her happiness is helping others know happiness. She is dependent. Without others, her life would be hollow. Empty Who is Katherine Wamer? She is a self-confident, yet shy little girl whose father is in the Air Force She's moved so many times before that this should be routine, but each time it gets harder and harder. She just can't say goodbye anymore. She doesn't want to go, but it is a warm, summer morning, but everyone inside the brick house is feeling cold. The children are aroused and teeth are brushed. Sleeping bags are rolled and stuffed in the car. Nothing remains except a few memories. Mom and Dad help the children into the car and get them buckled. They then climb into their own seats and say "Well adjust." But everyone's eyes are wet. "Why Alabama?" "What could be in Alabama? But there's no going back. The orders came. We move. Neighbors wave goodbye and friends turn away to hide their tears. Katherine presses her nose against the car window and watches the people slowly falling away behind. Suddenly her best trend Katie breaks into a run and starts chasing the car. She waves and laughs, but the tears still fall. Katherine doesn't notice the tears. She smiles and waves, and realizes that her parents were right. She​</a>

                                            The Collatz Conjecture
hardest math problems
DAVE LINKLETTER
In September 2019, news broke regarding progress on this 82-year-old question, thanks to prolific mathematician Terence Tao. And while the story of Tao’s breakthrough is promising, the problem isn’t fully solved yet.
A refresher on the Collatz Conjecture: It’s all about that function f(n), shown above, which takes even numbers and cuts them in half, while odd numbers get tripled and then added to 1. Take any natural number, apply f, then apply f again and again. You eventually land on 1, for every number we’ve ever checked. The Conjecture is that this is true for all natural numbers (positive integers from 1 through infinity).
Tao’s recent work is a near-solution to the Collatz Conjecture in some subtle ways. But he most likely can’t adapt his methods to yield a complete solution to the problem, as Tao subsequently explained. So, we might be working on it for decades longer.
The Conjecture lives in the math discipline known as Dynamical Systems, or the study of situations that change over time in semi-predictable ways. It looks like a simple, innocuous question, but that’s what makes it special. Why is such a basic question so hard to answer? It serves as a benchmark for our understanding; once we solve it, then we can proceed onto much more complicated matters.
The study of dynamical systems could become more robust than anyone today could imagine. But we’ll need to solve the Collatz Conjecture for the subject to flourish.

Goldbach’s Conjecture 
hardest math problems
CREATIVE COMMONS
One of the greatest unsolved mysteries in math is also very easy to write. Goldbach’s Conjecture is, “Every even number (greater than two) is the sum of two primes.” You check this in your head for small numbers: 18 is 13+5, and 42 is 23+19. Computers have checked the Conjecture for numbers up to some magnitude. But we need proof for all natural numbers.
Goldbach’s Conjecture precipitated from letters in 1742 between German mathematician Christian Goldbach and legendary Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, considered one of the greatest in math history. As Euler put it, “I regard [it] as a completely certain theorem, although I cannot prove it.”
Euler may have sensed what makes this problem counterintuitively hard to solve. When you look at larger numbers, they have more ways of being written as sums of primes, not less. Like how 3+5 is the only way to break 8 into two primes, but 42 can broken into 5+37, 11+31, 13+29, and 19+23. So it feels like Goldbach’s Conjecture is an understatement for very large numbers.

Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall, I think I'll fly

None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head
I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
They tell me I'm so humble, I say, "I'm turning red"
They let me lie to them and don't feel like they've been misled
They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?
Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me
They tell me I'm a god, I'm lost in the facade
Six-feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feelin' odd
No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
The people blend together but I would be lost without their love
Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?
When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch
Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
It hurts me just to think and I don't do pain
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall, I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
Lay still, restless
Losing sleep while I lose my mind
All thrill, no stress
All my muses left behind (left behind)

                                            My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

HerbosaFactors thatAffect theselectionwrittenI'm in the car, in a foreign country, 10,000 miles from home, feeling lost.My delegation and I were the only ones who spoke Filipino. It was really sunnyThursday, 3rd of July, 7:30 in the morning. I looked outside seeing jet planes flyout of Brussels International Airport. The people inside the car, aside from mydelegation, were Simon, an 11 year old kid, Freya, his sister, and their mom, whoonly spoke English the best.In Belguim, French and Dutch languages are spoken. In the Northern partof Belguim, also known as Flanders, people speak Dutch and in the southern part,in the region called Wallonia, they speak French. I thought how amazing it is fortwo totally different languages to be spoken in one country.Being in a different country makes me feel more proud to be Filipino. Thefact that we were sent as delegates from our country made the feeling morespecial. This exciting learning experience allowed me to recall my school trainingof being committed to excellence, competent, and proud Filipino. My goodeducation brought me here, and this is where I would want to serve mycountrymen.I met people of many races. I made friends with Lebanese kids - Husseinand Ramzi and German kids - Johan and Freddy who were really kind. I expectedthem to be really energetic, but they were quiet and shy the whole morning.Meeting people from different regions of the earth is just a rare opportunity that iswhy; I made the first move and befriended them.We were all welcomed by our host families. A host family is a family where youwould stay before your camp for three days. On the final day, campers were in a"Village," the camp as others call it.The first day went really fast. Before I knew it, it was 8:30 in the evening. It didn'tfeel that it was night, because the sun was still up. It's really incredible that a partof the world is still sunny even though it is nighttime already. Before I closed myeyes, 1 silently prayed to God for Him to guide me and my loved ones whom !have left behind in my home country.We had an "Earth Ceremony." In this rite, we had to bring soil from our countryand put it in a basin, and mix it. It represents our unity and our love for our MotherEarth​</a>

In September 2019, news broke regarding progress on this 82-year-old question, thanks to prolific mathematician Terence Tao. And while the story of Tao’s breakthrough is promising, the problem isn’t fully solved yet.
A refresher on the Collatz Conjecture: It’s all about that function f(n), shown above, which takes even numbers and cuts them in half, while odd numbers get tripled and then added to 1. Take any natural number, apply f, then apply f again and again. You eventually land on 1, for every number we’ve ever checked. The Conjecture is that this is true for all natural numbers (positive integers from 1 through infinity).
Tao’s recent work is a near-solution to the Collatz Conjecture in some subtle ways. But he most likely can’t adapt his methods to yield a complete solution to the problem, as Tao subsequently explained. So, we might be working on it for decades longer.
The Conjecture lives in the math discipline known as Dynamical Systems, or the study of situations that change over time in semi-predictable ways. It looks like a simple, innocuous question, but that’s what makes it special. Why is such a basic question so hard to answer? It serves as a benchmark for our understanding; once we solve it, then we can proceed onto much more complicated matters.
The study of dynamical systems could become more robust than anyone today could imagine. But we’ll need to solve the Collatz Conjecture for the subject to flourish.

Goldbach’s Conjecture 
hardest math problems
CREATIVE COMMONS
One of the greatest unsolved mysteries in math is also very easy to write. Goldbach’s Conjecture is, “Every even number (greater than two) is the sum of two primes.” You check this in your head for small numbers: 18 is 13+5, and 42 is 23+19. Computers have checked the Conjecture for numbers up to some magnitude. But we need proof for all natural numbers.
Goldbach’s Conjecture precipitated from letters in 1742 between German mathematician Christian Goldbach and legendary Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, considered one of the greatest in math history. As Euler put it, “I regard [it] as a completely certain theorem, although I cannot prove it.”
Euler may have sensed what makes this problem counterintuitively hard to solve. When you look at larger numbers, they have more ways of being written as sums of primes, not less. Like how 3+5 is the only way to break 8 into two primes, but 42 can broken into 5+37, 11+31, 13+29, and 19+23. So it feels like Goldbach’s Conjecture is an understatement for very large numbers.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The Riemann Hypothesis</strong></p><p><strong>The Riemann Hypothesis is considered by many to be the single most important unsolved problem in mathematics. The Riemann hypothesis concerns the roots of the Riemann zeta function, which is defined for all complex numbers s with a real part greater than 1 by the convergent series:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>It is known that when s is some negative even integer (-2, -4, -6,…), this series converges to 0. These are called the trivial zeros of the function and are located at every even negative number. Negative even integers are not the only inputs that result in a 0; these other values that result in 0 are called non-trivial zeros. The Riemann hypothesis concerns the location of all these other non-trivial zeros. It states:</strong><strong>RH: “Every non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function has a real part that is ½”</strong><strong>In other words, the Riemann hypothesis posits that all inputs (aside from negative even integers) that when plugged into the Riemann zeta function return a zero, will be in the form of a complex number a+bi where a = ½.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The Riemann hypothesis was first articulated by the German mathematician Bernhard Rieman</strong><strong> </strong><strong>in 1859. Riemann’s initial motivation in studying the zeta function was related to his work on the distribution of prime numbers along the number line. The Riemann hypothesis is a very important open question in mathematics because many other deep mathematical results rest on it being true.</strong><strong>For example, it is strongly believed that the truth of the Goldbach conjecture relies on the Reimann hypothesis being true.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Several weaker versions of the Goldbach conjecture have been proven on the assumption that the Reimann hypothesis is true. So, solving the Riemann hypothesis has many serious implications in other areas of mathematics.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>The Riemann hypothesis is one of the Millenium Prize Problems, a list of unsolved math problems compiled by the Clay Institute. The Clay Institute has offered a $1 million prize to anyone who can prove the Riemann hypothesis true or false.</strong></p><br />

                            16. My Mother, My Strength!
My mother always reminds me of freshly baked breads. The feeling is so warm with a sweet fragrance.
And I cannot help being drawn over just like a newly born baby. Despite this, the feeling I have for my
mom is ever changing. She is like a rose, so tough and so beautiful. She teaches me all that she knows in
what she thinks is the most appropriate time and way, raising me up to be a mature, sensible and strongminded girl.
As I grew up, I became curious about child-bearing. I learned from books and movies that the process was
very painful. Then I asked my mom whether she felt pains when she gave birth to me. Her face cutely
turned red and said 'not at all' with blinking eyes. She told me that she was willing to bear the pains to
have a lovely daughter like me. I was so moved that I could never forget her gentle, loving face.
She teaches in a vocational high school, which I would not like to tell others when I was young because
she is more of a care-taker for those so-called bad students rather than a professional English teacher.
However, she changed my minds with her great passion for her teaching career. Students in her school
usually skip classes, addict themselves to the Internet, and have quarrels with parents and teachers. I
cannot imagine how my mom deals with them, especially when she is the head teacher in charge of
around 40 students like this. Surprisingly, those students adore my mom so much that they call her
Mother Fan, which I am envy of.
They often visit our home and sometimes bring her flowers after graduation. One student even called my
mom when she decided to attend a 'blind date' party. I am very confused at the beginning because those
students are known for poor teacher-student relationships. Then I asked one of them. She told me that my
mom was a wonderful teacher -- she never pushes students and she always give them useful life
suggestions. It was then that I started to be proud of my mother for her 'special' teaching job.
My mom is also of super help when I encounter problems. I remember having nightmares at a very young
age. No matter how late it was, she would go to my room, and hold me tight until I slept safe and sound
again. When I was a school girl, she kept a close contact with my teachers. When I had troubles with
studies, she never blamed me but gave me faith that I could keep up if I tried hard. She is also a wonderful
cook. She takes care of me with great patience and cooks me different dishes every day. My mom is very
thrifty in life. However, she is never mean when it comes to me. She is also incredibly far-sighted,
sending me to participate in summer camps when I entered secondary school, which made me very
independent. Now that I am in university and far away from her, she can no longer take care of me.
Instead she gives me constructive advice when necessary. For example, when I had my first boyfriend,
she taught me not to depend on him too much and keep my own social circles. My boyfriend joined the
exchange program this year and it turned out that I could live comfortably without him, which is largely
thanks to my mother's suggestion.
'Mama is the dearest person to you in the world', just as the old song goes. My mom is the dearest person
to me and I admire her because of her patience, compassion and toughness.

                            21. In a Different Time ZoneRegino Costantino F. HerbosaFactors thatAffect theselectionwrittenI'm in the car, in a foreign country, 10,000 miles from home, feeling lost.My delegation and I were the only ones who spoke Filipino. It was really sunnyThursday, 3rd of July, 7:30 in the morning. I looked outside seeing jet planes flyout of Brussels International Airport. The people inside the car, aside from mydelegation, were Simon, an 11 year old kid, Freya, his sister, and their mom, whoonly spoke English the best.In Belguim, French and Dutch languages are spoken. In the Northern partof Belguim, also known as Flanders, people speak Dutch and in the southern part,in the region called Wallonia, they speak French. I thought how amazing it is fortwo totally different languages to be spoken in one country.Being in a different country makes me feel more proud to be Filipino. Thefact that we were sent as delegates from our country made the feeling morespecial. This exciting learning experience allowed me to recall my school trainingof being committed to excellence, competent, and proud Filipino. My goodeducation brought me here, and this is where I would want to serve mycountrymen.I met people of many races. I made friends with Lebanese kids - Husseinand Ramzi and German kids - Johan and Freddy who were really kind. I expectedthem to be really energetic, but they were quiet and shy the whole morning.Meeting people from different regions of the earth is just a rare opportunity that iswhy; I made the first move and befriended them.We were all welcomed by our host families. A host family is a family where youwould stay before your camp for three days. On the final day, campers were in a"Village," the camp as others call it.The first day went really fast. Before I knew it, it was 8:30 in the evening. It didn'tfeel that it was night, because the sun was still up. It's really incredible that a partof the world is still sunny even though it is nighttime already. Before I closed myeyes, 1 silently prayed to God for Him to guide me and my loved ones whom !have left behind in my home country.We had an "Earth Ceremony." In this rite, we had to bring soil from our countryand put it in a basin, and mix it. It represents our unity and our love for our MotherEarth​</h2><br />
