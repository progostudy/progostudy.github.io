                                            The Wonder of SensesResearchers suggest that there are creatures who do not know what light means at the bottom of the sea. They don't have either eyes or ears: they can only feel. There is no day nor night for them. There are no winters, no summers, no sun, no moon, and no stars. It is as if a child who spent its life in darkness in bed, with nothing to see or hear. How different our own life is! Sight shows us the ground beneath our feet and the heavens above us- the sun, moon, and stars, lighting and the sunset. It shows us day and night. We are able to hear voices, the sound of the sea, and music. We feel, we taste, and we smell. How fortunate we are.Comprehension Questions:1. What is the selection mainly about?2. What is sight?3. What do researchers tell about the creatures in the selection?4. In the selection, what is the child in the darkness compared to?5. Why are human beings so fortunate?6. Can we consider the blind and deaf useful members of society? Why it why not?7. How can we make a person who can't see or hear feel important?8. Can a person still enjoy life even if he/she cannot see or hear? Why?9. How can we fully utilize our gift of sight and sound to help others?10. What word in the selection refers to "receiving good luck"?•Auto report if nonsense•​</a>

A person who is healthy keeps doing things that are good for the body like eating nutritious foods, exercising and getting enough rest and sleep. We should be aware of personal health issues and concerns like height and weight, vision and hearing. Knowing these issues will make us observe healthy habits and lifestyles for us to live a healthy life.​</a>
