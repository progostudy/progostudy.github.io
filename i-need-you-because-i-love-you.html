Hello it's me i was wondering if after all this years you'd like to meet
Send me your location let's focus on communicating cause I just need the time and place to come through
You were the shadow to my light did you feel us another star you fade away 
Cause you were unforgettable i need to get you alone 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn but that's all right because I love the way it hurts
Can we pretend that airplanes and the night sky like shooting stars i could really use a wish right now wish right now wish right now
So love me like you do lo-lo-love me like you do touch me like you do to-to-touch me like you do ohh
I remember years ago someone told me that I should take caution when it comes to love i did 
Good luck </a>

You are the earth whose orbit marks my way And sets my north and south, my east and west, Your are the final, elemental clay The driven heart must turn to for its rest. If in your arms that hold me now so near I lift my keening thoughts to another one, As trees long rooted to the earth uprear Their quickening leaves and flowers to the sun, You who are earth, O never doubt that I Need you no less because I need the sky! II I can not love you with a love That outcompares the boundless sea, For that were false, as no such love And no such ocean can ever be. But I can love you with a love As finite as the wave that dies And dying holds from crest to crest The blue of everlasting skies.​</a>

                                            Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</a>

Hello it's me i was wondering if after all this years you'd like to meet
Send me your location let's focus on communicating cause I just need the time and place to come through
You were the shadow to my light did you feel us another star you fade away 
Cause you were unforgettable i need to get you alone 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn but that's all right because I love the way it hurts
Can we pretend that airplanes and the night sky like shooting stars i could really use a wish right now wish right now wish right now
So love me like you do lo-lo-love me like you do touch me like you do to-to-touch me like you do ohh
I remember years ago someone told me that I should take caution when it comes to love i did 
Good luck </h2><br />

                            22. Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</h2><br />
