Based on Lamarck's theory of evolution, when Jazerelle dyed her hair into blond,
will her descendant inherit the blond hair?
R. Yes, due to theory of need
S. Yes, due to theory of acquired traits
T. Yes, due to theory of use and disuse
U. No, it is not possible.
For item 2 &amp; 3, answer the questions based on the following situation

source of food available are only taller trees.
2. Using the theory use and disuse, how will the short neck giraffe survive the
environment?
K. The giraffe kept on stretching their necks until these become longer and
able to reach taller trees
L. The giraffe maintains its short necks and shifted to other source of food.
M. The short neck giraffe produces offspring with long neck.
N. The acquired traits of long neck are passed on to the next generation.

The kinetic energy doubles if you double the mass. 4. Object that has kinetic energy are not moving. 5. If work is done on an object by non-conservative force, then the object will either gain or lose kinetic energy. 6. An object has a kinetic energy of 40J, if its velocity twice as much, then its kinetic energy would be 80J. 7. Object A has a mass of lkg and a velocity of 2m/s. Object B has a mass of 2kg and a velocity of Im/s. Objects A and B have the same kinetic energy 8. An object has a kinetic energy of 40J if its mass were twice as much, then its kinetic energy would be 80J. 9. Alkg object accelerated from rest to a velocity of 2.0m/s.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The Philippines is one of the world's top producers of geothermal power, as it is located along the Ring of Fire zone of Pacific volcanoes. ... The Philippines currently has seven geothermal fields which supply about 12 percent of the nation's energy, with a long-term plan to nearly double capacity by 2040.</p><p></p><p>2.Geothermal energy is the cheapest form of clean energy out there, with wind energy a close second – and both could become cheaper than fossil fuel-fired energy if governments will direct more research funding to them.</p><p></p><p>3.First and foremost, geothermal energy is extracted from the earth without burning fossil fuels, and geothermal fields produce practically no emissions. What's more, geothermal energy can be very beneficial, as you can achieve savings of up to 80% over conventional energy usage.</p><p></p><p>4.It is considerably safer than most other energy sources. Unlike fossil fuel plants, geothermal power does not produce greenhouse gases (GHG) that are harmful to the environment. The Philippines is one of the world's top producers of geothermal power, as it is located along the Ring of Fire zone of Pacific volcanoes.</p><p></p><p>5.Geothermal hot water can be used for many applications that require heat. Its current uses include heating buildings (either individually or whole towns), raising plants in greenhouses, drying crops, heating water at fish farms, and several industrial processes, such as pasteurizing milk.</p><p>                        </p><p>hope it helps  </p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Trees improve water quality, and reduce flooding and erosion. A tree's leafy canopy catches precipitation before it reaches the ground, allowing some of it to gently drip and the rest to evaporate. Tree roots hold soil in place, reducing erosion. In these ways, trees lessen the force of storms and reduce the amount of runoff into sewers, streams, and rivers, improving water quality. One hundred mature trees can intercept about 100,000 gallons of rainfall per year.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps:D</p><br />

                            28. DIRECTIONS: Put a check in the box of your preferred answer YES NO 1. Kinetic energy is directly proportional to the mass of the object and to the square of each velocity. 2. Kinetic energy is a vector measurement because it has both magnitude and direction. 3. The kinetic energy doubles if you double the mass. 4. Object that has kinetic energy are not moving. 5. If work is done on an object by non-conservative force, then the object will either gain or lose kinetic energy. 6. An object has a kinetic energy of 40J, if its velocity twice as much, then its kinetic energy would be 80J. 7. Object A has a mass of lkg and a velocity of 2m/s. Object B has a mass of 2kg and a velocity of Im/s. Objects A and B have the same kinetic energy 8. An object has a kinetic energy of 40J if its mass were twice as much, then its kinetic energy would be 80J. 9. Alkg object accelerated from rest to a velocity of 2.0m/s. This object gains 4.0J of kinetic energy 10. If kinetic energy of an object is doubled, its velocity becomes v2 times the original value​</h2><br />
