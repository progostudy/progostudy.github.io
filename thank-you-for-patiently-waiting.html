What words were used to help youfigure out Jake's identity?4. Who was Max and what happened tohim?5. Do you believe in the adage, 'A dog isman's best friend'? Elaborate on youranswer.STORYJake’s eyes snap open, and he quickly turns to the side. But like his aching heart, the spot where Max always sat on the couch remains empty. He takes in a long, deep breath – really more of a sigh – and squeezes his eyes closed, hoping that by slipping into the darkness of a nap, he will temporarily mask his sorrow.For fifteen years they were inseparable. Always side by side. The walks on the beach with the gentle waves calling, the seagulls cawing. All those hikes on the trail where the trees canopied over like arches, wrapping them in a soft cool shade on a hot sunny day. Even just a ride to the grocery store for something Martha may have forgotten, they always went together.Though he knows that in some ways he should be thankful for just having their time together – those moments forever etched in his heart – and that the sickness took Max quickly rather than dragging out the pain for weeks, maybe even months, he still feels cheated. That somehow he is missing years that could have been.Unable to sleep, he looks around the all too empty room, letting his gaze fall upon the leash, which still hangs from the peg by the door. It seems to wait patiently, ever ready for that next big adventure. As his eyes well up, he realizes for the first time how much his grief weighs, how hard it is to even rise with such a heaviness inside.It is then he hears a shuffle from behind and turns to see Martha standing in the doorway, her shoulder resting against the frame.“I thought you might be in here,” she says. She looks down at him for only a moment before her stare drifts to the couch. “I miss him, too, Jake. More than you’ll ever know.”There’s a faraway melancholy tone to her voice, but he knows that her heart, like his, has a hole too big to fill. His head drops and he gives off another long sigh, which seems to prompt her to come over and kneel down onto the carpet beside him. She slides a hand under his chin and lifts it up, then tucks back his long, floppy ears, such that their teary eyes can meet.“I guess you do know, don’t you, Jake.”​</a>

                                            *The Tale of the White Squash*There once lived a couple who had a squash plant that gave them food to eat every day. Despite being childless both were happy for they liked nothing so much as boiled squash for dinner.One day they discovered that they had eaten their last squash. They waited patiently but no new fruit came. Oh God? They prayed, if you please give us some more squash fruit. Not long after, a white squash appeared. They were astonished for it was the first white squash they had ever seen. The couple could hardly wait for the fruit to ripen as soon as it was big enough, the husband said: “wife, pick the fruit and before she opened it, she heard a voice from it. “Please don’t hurt me” said the voice.“Husband” cried the woman “come here” this squash can talk. Don’t be afool, replied her husband. At your age you ought to know that no squash can talk. “But please do not hurt me”, said the voice. Upon hearing the man,himself took the knife and carefully cut the fruit open. And a beautiful baby stood up and smiled.“Thank you for letting let me out.”After recovering from their surprised the wife proceeded to fetch water from the well. She spread a mat on the floor and laid the baby on it. She started to bathe in the baby but to her surprise, the water splashed on the baby’s body rolled down to the mat as shining piece of gold. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever. The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.Analysis and Discussion:1. Who were the main characters in the story?2. What did they see after cutting the squash carefully?3. What happens every time the wife bathes the baby?4. Did the couple appreciate the opportunity given to them?5. Explain “Money is the root of all evil”. Is this saying true in the story?​</a>

                            4. 1. What did you feel after reading thestory? Expound your answer.2. Based on the story, who is Jake and whyis he in a state of loneliness?3. What words were used to help youfigure out Jake's identity?4. Who was Max and what happened tohim?5. Do you believe in the adage, 'A dog isman's best friend'? Elaborate on youranswer.STORYJake’s eyes snap open, and he quickly turns to the side. But like his aching heart, the spot where Max always sat on the couch remains empty. He takes in a long, deep breath – really more of a sigh – and squeezes his eyes closed, hoping that by slipping into the darkness of a nap, he will temporarily mask his sorrow.For fifteen years they were inseparable. Always side by side. The walks on the beach with the gentle waves calling, the seagulls cawing. All those hikes on the trail where the trees canopied over like arches, wrapping them in a soft cool shade on a hot sunny day. Even just a ride to the grocery store for something Martha may have forgotten, they always went together.Though he knows that in some ways he should be thankful for just having their time together – those moments forever etched in his heart – and that the sickness took Max quickly rather than dragging out the pain for weeks, maybe even months, he still feels cheated. That somehow he is missing years that could have been.Unable to sleep, he looks around the all too empty room, letting his gaze fall upon the leash, which still hangs from the peg by the door. It seems to wait patiently, ever ready for that next big adventure. As his eyes well up, he realizes for the first time how much his grief weighs, how hard it is to even rise with such a heaviness inside.It is then he hears a shuffle from behind and turns to see Martha standing in the doorway, her shoulder resting against the frame.“I thought you might be in here,” she says. She looks down at him for only a moment before her stare drifts to the couch. “I miss him, too, Jake. More than you’ll ever know.”There’s a faraway melancholy tone to her voice, but he knows that her heart, like his, has a hole too big to fill. His head drops and he gives off another long sigh, which seems to prompt her to come over and kneel down onto the carpet beside him. She slides a hand under his chin and lifts it up, then tucks back his long, floppy ears, such that their teary eyes can meet.“I guess you do know, don’t you, Jake.”​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. The story is saddening.  After realizing how sorrowful the story is, I could feel the characters’ grief for the loss of their loved one.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Jake is Max’s dog, his best friend.  He is in a state of loneliness because his owner, Max, died.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. I figured out Jake’s identity through the phrases “kneel down onto the carpet” and “tucks back his long, floppy ears”.
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Max is Jake’s owner and best friend, and Martha’s partner I suppose.  He died due to a sickness.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. I believe that a dog is a man’s best friend because once a dog gets comfortable to its owner, it always goes with its owner.  Just like the story of Jake and Max, they went through places and did things together.  Having a best friend dog is incomparable because of the attachment and love a dog only can give.

WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE MESSAGE OF THE STORY?​</p><p>** I think the message of the story is that animals are as important as humans because they are also a family. We should always value and love animals just like Jake did. He values his pet. If we try to look around us, animals are hurt by some humans because they are thinking that they are JUST animals.

                            15. *The Tale of the White Squash*There once lived a couple who had a squash plant that gave them food to eat every day. Despite being childless both were happy for they liked nothing so much as boiled squash for dinner.One day they discovered that they had eaten their last squash. They waited patiently but no new fruit came. Oh God? They prayed, if you please give us some more squash fruit. Not long after, a white squash appeared. They were astonished for it was the first white squash they had ever seen. The couple could hardly wait for the fruit to ripen as soon as it was big enough, the husband said: “wife, pick the fruit and before she opened it, she heard a voice from it. “Please don’t hurt me” said the voice.“Husband” cried the woman “come here” this squash can talk. Don’t be afool, replied her husband. At your age you ought to know that no squash can talk. “But please do not hurt me”, said the voice. Upon hearing the man,himself took the knife and carefully cut the fruit open. And a beautiful baby stood up and smiled.“Thank you for letting let me out.”After recovering from their surprised the wife proceeded to fetch water from the well. She spread a mat on the floor and laid the baby on it. She started to bathe in the baby but to her surprise, the water splashed on the baby’s body rolled down to the mat as shining piece of gold. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever. The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.Analysis and Discussion:1. Who were the main characters in the story?2. What did they see after cutting the squash carefully?3. What happens every time the wife bathes the baby?4. Did the couple appreciate the opportunity given to them?5. Explain “Money is the root of all evil”. Is this saying true in the story?​</h2><br />
