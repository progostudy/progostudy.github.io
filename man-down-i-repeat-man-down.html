                    <p>I am a kind word uttered and repeated 
By the voice of Nature; 
I am a star fallen from the 
Blue tent upon the green carpet. 
I am the daughter of the elements 
With whom Winter conceived; 
To whom Spring gave birth; I was 
Reared in the lap of Summer and I 
Slept in the bed of Autumn. 
At dawn I unite with the breeze 
To announce the coming of light; 
At eventide I join the birds 
In bidding the light farewell. 
The plains are decorated with 
My beautiful colors, and the air 
Is scented with my fragrance. 
As I embrace Slumber the eyes of 
Night watch over me, and as I 
Awaken I stare at the sun, which is 
The only eye of the day. 
I drink dew for wine, and hearken to 
The voices of the birds, and dance 
To the rhythmic swaying of the grass. 
I am the lover&#039;s gift; I am the wedding wreath; 
I am the memory of a moment of happiness; 
I am the last gift of the living to the dead; 
I am a part of joy and a part of sorrow. 
But I look up high to see only the light, 
And never look down to see my shadow. 
This is wisdom which man must learn.

                                            The Sun and the Moon Once upon a time, there lived a poor woman with her son and daughter. She did chores for other families for a living. One day, she went to work for a rich man’s party and got some rice cakes there. “My children must be hungry,” said the woman hurrying home. On the way home, she met a big tiger. “Give me a piece of rice cake. Then I will not eat you,” said the tiger. The woman gave a piece of rice cake to the tiger. But the tiger kept following the woman. “Give me a piece of rice cake. Then I will not eat you,” repeated the tiger. The woman gave another piece of rice cake to the tiger. The tiger kept asking her for more rice cakes. She gave away all the rice cakes to the tiger. Now she had no more rice cake. So the tiger ate her. Now the tiger put on her clothes and went to her house. He pretended to be the children’s mom. “Open the door, dear,” said the tiger. “You are not my mom. Your voice is too hoarse. Her voice is soft,” said the brother. “Oh, is it? Hmm, I have a cold.” “Then, show me your hands,” said the sister. The tiger showed his hands to them. “Your hands are too hairy and dark. Her hands are white,” said the brother. The tiger covered his hands with flour. And he showed his white hands to the children. Then the children opened the door. The tiger entered the house saying “I will make dinner. Wait here.” Then, the brother saw the tiger’s tail. “It’s not Mom. It’s a tiger,” said the brother. “What should we do?” said the sister. “We have to run away from here,” said the brother. The children ran out of the house and climbed up a tree near the well. The tiger looked for them here and there. Then, he saw the children’s face reflected on the water inside the well. “Oh, you are in the well. I will scoop you up with this bowl,” said the tiger. The sister in the tree laughed at the tiger. “Oh, you are in the tree.” The tiger tried to climb up the tree. But he could not do it. “How did you climb up the tree?” said the tiger. “We used oil,” lied the brother. The tiger rubbed some oil on his hands. And he tried to climb up the tree. But he only slid down. Laughing at the tiger, the sister told the secret of how to climb up. “You could use an ax,” said the sister. Then the tiger made small cuts on the tree with an ax. Then, he could climb up the tree. The children were frightened so they prayed to God. “If you want us to live, please hand down a rope,” pleaded the children as they looked up towards God. Then a rope came down from the sky. The children held onto it and went up to the sky. The tiger could not catch the children. The tiger prayed to God, too.“If you want me to catch them, please hand down a rope.” Then another rope came down from the sky. The tiger held onto it and went up to the sky. But the rope was rotten. The tiger fell down. The children went up to the sky. The brother became the sun. And the sister became the moon. “I am scared of the night,” said the sister. “I will be the moon for you instead,” said the brother. So the brother became the moon. And the sister became the sun.

                            1. I am a kind word uttered and repeated 
By the voice of Nature; 
I am a star fallen from the 
Blue tent upon the green carpet. 
I am the daughter of the elements 
With whom Winter conceived; 
To whom Spring gave birth; I was 
Reared in the lap of Summer and I 
Slept in the bed of Autumn. 
At dawn I unite with the breeze 
To announce the coming of light; 
At eventide I join the birds 
In bidding the light farewell. 
The plains are decorated with 
My beautiful colors, and the air 
Is scented with my fragrance. 
As I embrace Slumber the eyes of 
Night watch over me, and as I 
Awaken I stare at the sun, which is 
The only eye of the day. 
I drink dew for wine, and hearken to 
The voices of the birds, and dance 
To the rhythmic swaying of the grass. 
I am the lover's gift; I am the wedding wreath; 
I am the memory of a moment of happiness; 
I am the last gift of the living to the dead; 
I am a part of joy and a part of sorrow. 
But I look up high to see only the light, 
And never look down to see my shadow. 
This is wisdom which man must learn.

                            2. The Sun and the Moon Once upon a time, there lived a poor woman with her son and daughter. She did chores for other families for a living. One day, she went to work for a rich man’s party and got some rice cakes there. “My children must be hungry,” said the woman hurrying home. On the way home, she met a big tiger. “Give me a piece of rice cake. Then I will not eat you,” said the tiger. The woman gave a piece of rice cake to the tiger. But the tiger kept following the woman. “Give me a piece of rice cake. Then I will not eat you,” repeated the tiger. The woman gave another piece of rice cake to the tiger. The tiger kept asking her for more rice cakes. She gave away all the rice cakes to the tiger. Now she had no more rice cake. So the tiger ate her. Now the tiger put on her clothes and went to her house. He pretended to be the children’s mom. “Open the door, dear,” said the tiger. “You are not my mom. Your voice is too hoarse. Her voice is soft,” said the brother. “Oh, is it? Hmm, I have a cold.” “Then, show me your hands,” said the sister. The tiger showed his hands to them. “Your hands are too hairy and dark. Her hands are white,” said the brother. The tiger covered his hands with flour. And he showed his white hands to the children. Then the children opened the door. The tiger entered the house saying “I will make dinner. Wait here.” Then, the brother saw the tiger’s tail. “It’s not Mom. It’s a tiger,” said the brother. “What should we do?” said the sister. “We have to run away from here,” said the brother. The children ran out of the house and climbed up a tree near the well. The tiger looked for them here and there. Then, he saw the children’s face reflected on the water inside the well. “Oh, you are in the well. I will scoop you up with this bowl,” said the tiger. The sister in the tree laughed at the tiger. “Oh, you are in the tree.” The tiger tried to climb up the tree. But he could not do it. “How did you climb up the tree?” said the tiger. “We used oil,” lied the brother. The tiger rubbed some oil on his hands. And he tried to climb up the tree. But he only slid down. Laughing at the tiger, the sister told the secret of how to climb up. “You could use an ax,” said the sister. Then the tiger made small cuts on the tree with an ax. Then, he could climb up the tree. The children were frightened so they prayed to God. “If you want us to live, please hand down a rope,” pleaded the children as they looked up towards God. Then a rope came down from the sky. The children held onto it and went up to the sky. The tiger could not catch the children. The tiger prayed to God, too.“If you want me to catch them, please hand down a rope.” Then another rope came down from the sky. The tiger held onto it and went up to the sky. But the rope was rotten. The tiger fell down. The children went up to the sky. The brother became the sun. And the sister became the moon. “I am scared of the night,” said the sister. “I will be the moon for you instead,” said the brother. So the brother became the moon. And the sister became the sun.
