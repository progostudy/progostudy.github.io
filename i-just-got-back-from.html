They've got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo
All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from holding back from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off</a>

                                            Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
Didn't really care about how everyone felt
Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays
Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I went down a road that only got me nowhere
I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
Being all alone it really got me thinking
Maybe overthinking
That what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from

From which point of view is the story written?Tell Me a Story About Your ShoesOne Thursday morning at a soup kitchen /community center for homeless wo downtown Boston I was given this gift of a story in response to the opening prompt, Tell me abo your shoes."I pass this story along now in honor of the woman who shared tYou see these beautiful white sneakers? I didn't always have them. My last pair of shoes was pretty sad. After many winters of walking the show and slush, I was holding them together with cardboard and masking tape. So I decided to go to the mall to get a new pair. There's a shoes story there that often has sneakers I can afford. Walking through the mall I knew everyone was looking at me being there. I wanted to get my new shoes quick and leave. Walking down the aisle, I saw a really nice pair of white sneakers. There was only this one pair in my size left I put them on and couldn't believe how good they felt: I walk all around the store in them, thinking how rice it would be if they were mine knew I didn't have money to get them that day but I also knew that if I waited they'd be gone, I brought them up to the front of the store and asked the guy behind the counter of he would hold them for me. He said it was against store policy. I promised hem I would come back as soon as I could to buy them but he just kept shaking his head and saying no, he couldn't. I put my masking tape sneakers back on and left the mall as fast as I couldFor the next two weeks, I scraped by until had enough money to go back for my shoes Funny how I kept calling them mine, as if somehow I could protect them from going home with anyone else. The day I had enough money, I ran all the way to the mall, and ignored all those people staring at my masking tape shoes. I went to the shelf where I left them, with my eyes half shut afraid to look Sure enough they were gone. I looked at every pair of shoes in the aide that had my site, but there were no shoes left like them. They were gone.I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day, I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me. I started to walk faster to get away, but he an after me still yelling "I have your shoes. me a few times of hearing it to get what be meant I HAVE YOUR SHOES "OK", I said. "Tve got the money now to pay for them." "No. No, he said "They've been pad for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours"I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day. I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me, I started to walk faster to get away, but he ran after me, still yelling. "I have your shoes." It took me a few times of hearing it to get what he meant. 1 HAVE YOUR SHOES. "OK", I said. "I've got the money now to pay for them." "No. No", he said "They've been paid for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours"1 can't tell you what when on in my head in that moment. I only remember leaving my old shoes in the trash bin and walking out into the mall wearing my new white sneakers with money still in my pocket. I took my time leaving that day.As I walked past each stranger, I looked them in the eye and smiled. I felt so good. It wasn't that I thought that they were looking at me differently because of my new sneakers. It was more that i was seeing them differently. I used to think no one was on my side. But that day I knew that any person I walked by could be the one who gave my new shoes. Whoever they were, I wanted them to know I was saying, "Thank you".need the answer now :) thank you...​</a>

It happened last week.I Woke up late because my alarm clock didn't ring. I got up quickly and had a shower in a hurry, and as you guessdidn't have enough time to eat breakfastI was driving my car fast in hoping i wouldn't be late for work, and that prevented me from taking a good look at thetraffic lights. I failed o stop when the light was red.The policeman just stopped his motorbike night in front of my car. He got down his motorbike and approached me."Good morning! You ran the red light. Can I see your driving license and paper, please?" he said as I was getting out ofmy car.I Tapped my back pocket trying to find my wallet where I have my driving license and paper. But the wallet was not thereChecked my handbag in the car. It was not there either.Luckily I had some money in my other pocket. Caught a public transport and went back home. 30 minutes later I gotback to my car. Chowed the policeman my driving license and paper and he gave me a ticket for running the red lightand for failing to produce my driving license and paper.By this time I was 45 minutes late for work. I was sure my boss vould be very angry. I had to drive to my orice evenfaster. But ihere was another problem; I couldn't find my car key. Perfect! i left my car key at home!​</a>

                                            If i told i was perfect i'd be lying
If there's something i'm not doing, girl i'm trying
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad (no no no)
If you see me at the party conversating
That doesn’t mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad
You should know, these
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go
These
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)</a>

                                            1)What’s in the basement?•Mommy told me never to go in the basement, but I wanted to see what was making that noise. It kind of sounded like a puppy, and I wanted to see the puppy, so I opened the basement door and tiptoed down a bit. I didn’t see a puppy, and then Mommy yanked me out of the basement and yelled at me. Mommy had never yelled at me before, and it made me sad and I cried. Then Mommy told me never to go into the basement again, and she gave me a cookie. That made me feel better, so I didn’t ask her why the boy in the basement was making noises like a puppy, or why he had no hands or feet2)Mommy’s home•I heard one, a father is laying in bed after just waking up, he grabs the baby monitor and walks to his desk in his office at home, he has his baby on the baby monitor and hears his wife singing to her, he cracks a smile as he hears his wife “Go to sleep… go to sleep…” When suddenly the front door opens up and his wife comes in with groceries.3)“Yees?“•When I was a child my family moved to a big old two-floor house, with big empty rooms and creaking floorboards. Both my parents worked so I was often alone when I came home from school. One early evening when I came home the house was still dark.I called out, “Mum?” and heard her sing song voice say “Yees?” from upstairs. I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in, and again got the same “Yees?” reply. We were decorating at the time, and I didn’t know my way around the maze of rooms but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall. I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural so I rushed forward to see my mum, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother’s presence always does.Just as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself in to the room I heard the front door downstairs open and my mother call “Sweetie, are you home?” in a cheery voice. I jumped back, startled and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack. For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don’t know what it was, but it was staring at me​</a>

                                            2. There once lived a salt merchant. He had a monkey for his assistance. Every morning, he would load a sack of salt on the donkey and go to the nearby town to sell it. On the way, they had to walk across a pond. One day, while crossing the pond, the donkey thought,"Ooh! This load is so heavy that I become exhausted very soon. I wish I could get some of this load taken off my back." Just then the donkey tripped and fell into the water. Fortunately, the donkey was not hurt. But the sack of salt on the donkey's back fell into the water. Both the donkey and the salt became wet. Some of the salt in the sack got dissolved, making the load on the donkey lighter. The donkey felt very happy about the reduction in the weight of the sack of salt on its back. The merchant did his best to help the donkey to get up and they carried on their journey. From that day, it became a regular practice for the donkey to slip and fall in the pond whenever they crossed the pond to the market. This would dissolve some salt in the sack thus reducing the weight and relieving the donkey of some load. The merchant was not aware of the donkey's cunningness. This continued for a few days. One day, the merchant noticed the donkey deliberately slipping and landing with the sack into the water. "Oh! So this is the way I am losing my salt everyday" he thought. He decided to teach the donkey a lesson. Next morning, instead of loading a sack of salt, the merchant loaded a sack of cotton on the donkey's back. As usual they had decided to reach the market by crossing the same pond. While crossing the same pond, the donkey, as usual, slipped and fell into the pond, hoping that after some time the weight of the sack would go reduced. As usual, both the donkey and the cotton would become wet. But this time, when he got up, the load on his back seemed heavier. "Ooh! The Load seems to have gotten heavier," thought the donkey. The donkey was astonished at what had taken place against the usual result. The merchant looked at the donkey and said, "Dear friend, I saw you fall into the water of the pond deliberately every day with the malicious intention of reducing the weight of the salt. So, I loaded a sack of cotton today. Cotton when wet gets more weight and becomes heavier. Now you will have to carry it to the town." The poor donkey had learnt his lesson. 1.characters2.setting3.point of view4.themePASAGOT PO PLS.​</a>

I want to thank my (family, parents, brothers, sisters), for making this party possible, for helping me so much in all the preparations, couldn't have done it without you guys! You had such great ideas and it sounded like such a big deal to organize in the beginning, but we all did our parts and it came together really nicely!

                                            Tell Me a Story About Your Shoes
One Thursday morning at a soup kitchen /community center for homeless women in downtown
Boston, I was given this gift of a story in response to the opening prompt, Tell me about your shoes.” I
pass this story along now in honor of the woman who shared it. You see these beautiful white
sneakers? I didn’t always have them. My last pair of shoes was pretty sad. After many winters of
walking the snow and slush, I was holding them together with cardboard and masking tape. So, I
decided to go to the mall to get a new pair. There’s a shoe store there that often has sneakers I can
afford. Walking through the mall I knew everyone was looking at me being there. I wanted to get my
new shoes quick and leave.
Walking down the aisle, I saw a really nice pair of white sneakers. There was only this one pair
in my size left. I put them on and couldn’t believe how good they felt. I walk all around the store in
them, thinking how nice it would be if they were mine. I knew I didn’t have money to get them that day
but I also knew that if I waited, they ‘d be gone. I brought them up to the front of the store and asked
the guy behind the counter if he would hold them for me. He said it was against store policy. I
promised him I would come back as soon as I could to buy them but he just kept shaking his head
and saying no, he couldn’t.
I put my masking tape sneakers back on and left the mall as fast as I could. For the next two
weeks, I scraped by until I had enough money to go back for my shoes. Funny how I kept calling
them mine, as if somehow, I could protect them from going home with anyone else. The day I had
enough money, I ran all the way to the mall, and ignored all those people staring at my masking tape
shoes. I went to the shelf where I left them, with my eyes half shut afraid to look. Sure, enough they
were gone. I looked at every pair of shoes in the aisle that had my size, but there were no shoes left
like them. They were gone.
I started for the door; I wasn’t ready to try on anything else that day. I just felt too worn down to
look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me, I started to walk faster to get away, but he ran
after me, still yelling. “I have your shoes.” It took me a few times of hearing it to get what he meant. ‘I
HAVE YOUR SHOES. “OK”, I said. “I’ve got the money now to pay for them.” “No. No”, he said
“They’ve been paid for. That’s why I’ve got them.They’re now yours” I can’t tell you what when on in my head in that moment. I only remember
leaving my old shoes in the trash bin and walking out into the mall wearing my new white sneakers
with money still in my pocket. I took my time leaving that day.
As I walked past each stranger, I looked them in the eye and smiled. I felt so good. It wasn’t
that I thought that they were looking at me differently because of my new sneakers. It was more that I
was seeing them differently. I used to think no one was on my side. But that day I knew that any
person I walked by could be the one who gave my new shoes. Whoever they were, I wanted them to
know I was saying, “Thank you”.

She hummed a happy tune while walking As she went along, she began thinking of what she would do with the money she would get for the milk. "I'll buy some chicken from Mang Tomas," said she, "and they will lay eggs each morning, then I will sell the eggs to the mayor's wife. With the money that I will get from the sale of egys, I'm sure I can buy myself a cute dress and a hat; and when I got to the market I would be a muse. Won't all the young men come up and speak to mel Ana will be that jealous, but I don't care. I shall just look at her and toss my head like this." As she spoke, she tossed her head back, the pail fell down, and all the milk was spilled. She had to go home and tell her mother what happened. In the beginning... Suddenly...

Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
Didn't really care about how everyone felt
Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays
Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I went down a road that only got me nowhere
I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
Being all alone it really got me thinking
Maybe overthinking
That what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these
I ain't gonna hide these
Hide these
Hide these beautiful scars

I wanted to get my new shoes quick and leave. Walking down the aisle, I saw a really nice pair of white sneakers.

She hummed a happy tune while walking. As she went along, she began thinking of what she would do with the money she would get for the milk. "I'll buy some chicken from Mang Tomas," said she, "and they will lay eggs each moming, then I will sell the eggs to the mayor's wife. With the money that I will get from the sale of eggs, I'm sure ! can buy myself a cute dress and a hat; and when I got to the market I would be a muse. Won't all the young men come up and speak to me! Ana will be that jealous, but don't care. I shall just look at her and toss my head like this."

There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo
All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from holding back from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha)

Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
Didn't really care about how everyone felt
Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays
Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I went down a road that only got me nowhere
I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
Being all alone it really got me thinking
Maybe overthinking
That what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become

                            8. If i told i was perfect i'd be lying
If there's something i'm not doing, girl i'm trying
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad (no no no)
If you see me at the party conversating
That doesn’t mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad
You should know, these
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go
These
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you)</h2><br />

                            13. 1)What’s in the basement?•Mommy told me never to go in the basement, but I wanted to see what was making that noise. It kind of sounded like a puppy, and I wanted to see the puppy, so I opened the basement door and tiptoed down a bit. I didn’t see a puppy, and then Mommy yanked me out of the basement and yelled at me. Mommy had never yelled at me before, and it made me sad and I cried. Then Mommy told me never to go into the basement again, and she gave me a cookie. That made me feel better, so I didn’t ask her why the boy in the basement was making noises like a puppy, or why he had no hands or feet2)Mommy’s home•I heard one, a father is laying in bed after just waking up, he grabs the baby monitor and walks to his desk in his office at home, he has his baby on the baby monitor and hears his wife singing to her, he cracks a smile as he hears his wife “Go to sleep… go to sleep…” When suddenly the front door opens up and his wife comes in with groceries.3)“Yees?“•When I was a child my family moved to a big old two-floor house, with big empty rooms and creaking floorboards. Both my parents worked so I was often alone when I came home from school. One early evening when I came home the house was still dark.I called out, “Mum?” and heard her sing song voice say “Yees?” from upstairs. I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in, and again got the same “Yees?” reply. We were decorating at the time, and I didn’t know my way around the maze of rooms but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall. I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural so I rushed forward to see my mum, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother’s presence always does.Just as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself in to the room I heard the front door downstairs open and my mother call “Sweetie, are you home?” in a cheery voice. I jumped back, startled and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack. For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don’t know what it was, but it was staring at me​</h2><br />

                            16. 2. There once lived a salt merchant. He had a monkey for his assistance. Every morning, he would load a sack of salt on the donkey and go to the nearby town to sell it. On the way, they had to walk across a pond. One day, while crossing the pond, the donkey thought,"Ooh! This load is so heavy that I become exhausted very soon. I wish I could get some of this load taken off my back." Just then the donkey tripped and fell into the water. Fortunately, the donkey was not hurt. But the sack of salt on the donkey's back fell into the water. Both the donkey and the salt became wet. Some of the salt in the sack got dissolved, making the load on the donkey lighter. The donkey felt very happy about the reduction in the weight of the sack of salt on its back. The merchant did his best to help the donkey to get up and they carried on their journey. From that day, it became a regular practice for the donkey to slip and fall in the pond whenever they crossed the pond to the market. This would dissolve some salt in the sack thus reducing the weight and relieving the donkey of some load. The merchant was not aware of the donkey's cunningness. This continued for a few days. One day, the merchant noticed the donkey deliberately slipping and landing with the sack into the water. "Oh! So this is the way I am losing my salt everyday" he thought. He decided to teach the donkey a lesson. Next morning, instead of loading a sack of salt, the merchant loaded a sack of cotton on the donkey's back. As usual they had decided to reach the market by crossing the same pond. While crossing the same pond, the donkey, as usual, slipped and fell into the pond, hoping that after some time the weight of the sack would go reduced. As usual, both the donkey and the cotton would become wet. But this time, when he got up, the load on his back seemed heavier. "Ooh! The Load seems to have gotten heavier," thought the donkey. The donkey was astonished at what had taken place against the usual result. The merchant looked at the donkey and said, "Dear friend, I saw you fall into the water of the pond deliberately every day with the malicious intention of reducing the weight of the salt. So, I loaded a sack of cotton today. Cotton when wet gets more weight and becomes heavier. Now you will have to carry it to the town." The poor donkey had learnt his lesson. 1.characters2.setting3.point of view4.themePASAGOT PO PLS.​</h2><br />

As I walked my way to school this morning, I remembered how my classmate Tim bullied me. I finally got the chance to tell him "Thanks for your nice words Tim. You always make my day", "You are the best person that I've known in the whole world", He was just silent. I am the biggest boy in class and yet I could not defend myself from Tim.

                            24. Tell Me a Story About Your Shoes
One Thursday morning at a soup kitchen /community center for homeless women in downtown
Boston, I was given this gift of a story in response to the opening prompt, Tell me about your shoes.” I
pass this story along now in honor of the woman who shared it. You see these beautiful white
sneakers? I didn’t always have them. My last pair of shoes was pretty sad. After many winters of
walking the snow and slush, I was holding them together with cardboard and masking tape. So, I
decided to go to the mall to get a new pair. There’s a shoe store there that often has sneakers I can
afford. Walking through the mall I knew everyone was looking at me being there. I wanted to get my
new shoes quick and leave.
Walking down the aisle, I saw a really nice pair of white sneakers. There was only this one pair
in my size left. I put them on and couldn’t believe how good they felt. I walk all around the store in
them, thinking how nice it would be if they were mine. I knew I didn’t have money to get them that day
but I also knew that if I waited, they ‘d be gone. I brought them up to the front of the store and asked
the guy behind the counter if he would hold them for me. He said it was against store policy. I
promised him I would come back as soon as I could to buy them but he just kept shaking his head
and saying no, he couldn’t.
I put my masking tape sneakers back on and left the mall as fast as I could. For the next two
weeks, I scraped by until I had enough money to go back for my shoes. Funny how I kept calling
them mine, as if somehow, I could protect them from going home with anyone else. The day I had
enough money, I ran all the way to the mall, and ignored all those people staring at my masking tape
shoes. I went to the shelf where I left them, with my eyes half shut afraid to look. Sure, enough they
were gone. I looked at every pair of shoes in the aisle that had my size, but there were no shoes left
like them. They were gone.
I started for the door; I wasn’t ready to try on anything else that day. I just felt too worn down to
look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me, I started to walk faster to get away, but he ran
after me, still yelling. “I have your shoes.” It took me a few times of hearing it to get what he meant. ‘I
HAVE YOUR SHOES. “OK”, I said. “I’ve got the money now to pay for them.” “No. No”, he said
“They’ve been paid for. That’s why I’ve got them.They’re now yours” I can’t tell you what when on in my head in that moment. I only remember
leaving my old shoes in the trash bin and walking out into the mall wearing my new white sneakers
with money still in my pocket. I took my time leaving that day.
As I walked past each stranger, I looked them in the eye and smiled. I felt so good. It wasn’t
that I thought that they were looking at me differently because of my new sneakers. It was more that I
was seeing them differently. I used to think no one was on my side. But that day I knew that any
person I walked by could be the one who gave my new shoes. Whoever they were, I wanted them to
know I was saying, “Thank you”.

Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
Didn't really care about how everyone felt
Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays
Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I went down a road that only got me nowhere
I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
Being all alone it really got me thinking
Maybe overthinking
That what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
Hide these beautiful scars
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason that I'm feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars
Hide these

: One day Roland came home from work very tired...

: Mercy, that's not an excuse. I've been working hard all day. I expect to have dinner when I got home. Can you imagine how hard I work just so I could provide for this family?
: Roland, please, the children can hear you.
