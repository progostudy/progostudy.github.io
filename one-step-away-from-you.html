This is used to hold fabric temporarily in place, until permanently stitched There are four types of basting; hand basting machine basting, pin basting and basting edges with an iron. Running Stitch To make this stitch, push point of needle in and out of fabric until you have several stitches on the needle. Hold fabric taut with left hand, pull the needle through. Practice until you make fine even stitches. Outline Stitch This stitch is similar to the back stitch but it is slanted Make one slanted backstitch in front of another letting each one overlap the one before it just a little bit, until the design is filled Blanket Stitch Put your needle in 1/4 inch from the edge of the fabric, put the thread under the point of the needle and pull through بندشدن * Catch Stitch This is used for a flat finish next to fabric, such as seam , binding on a hem. Hold open hem edge away from your world from left to right, Take a stitch in the hem, then a tiny stitch to the right just beyond edge of hem with the point of needle to the left. This makes diagonal lined that cross each other​</a>

                                            Each lab group should pick up the following from the teacher: scissors tape measure tape single-hole hole punch dark orange or dark red paper (at least 7 by 7cm) flashlight with a well focused emission of light and light end no more than 5 cm in diameter graphing calculator or computer with software to perform a power regression on your data Find a blank, flat wall to shine a light onto and a table or chair that can stabilize the flashlight for this lab. If you have a nice blank wall near the end of a lab table, you can just put the light on top of the table. You will need to be able to move the light (whether along the table or by moving the chair) at least 1 meter in distance closer to or away from the wall. Use the hole punch to punch a hole in the center of the dark orange or dark red paper. Tape the paper to the light end of the flashlight, making sure the hole is roughly centered over the light. Place the flashlight on the chair or table at least 10 cm from the wall. You can adjust it with papers or books so that it is level (i.e., the light beam shines perpendicular on the wall). Measure the distance from the wall to the hole on the front of the flashlight. Record this distance in your data table. Turn the flashlight on. You should see a distinct white circle projected on the wall. The rest of the light emitted outside of this light should be a shade of the colored paper taped to the flashlight. Illustration of the lab set-up Illustration of the lab set-up. (Credit: NASA/Imagine the Universe) Take 3 different measurements of the diameter of the circle of white light on the wall. HINT: Remember, the diameter of a circle is the longest measured chord from one edge of the circle to the other. Therefore, you know you've got the diameter when you hold one end of the tape measure on one side (edge) of the circle and get the largest measured value by moving the other end of the tape measure along the other side. Record these values in the data chart. Calculate the mean and record it as well. Move the chair with the flashlight (or move along the table) about 20 cm further away from the wall. Measure the distance from the wall to the hole on the front of the flashlight. Record this distance on your data table. Repeat steps 6-8 at least two more times. Calculate the radius from each mean diameter. Record each calculation in the data table. Calculate the area of the circle formed from each calculated radius. Record each calculation in the data table. HINT: Area of a circle equals π r2. In your graphics calculator, enter the distance from the hole to the wall as one list and the area of each calculated circle as another list. Plot the data in the lists as a scatter plot. What kind of relationship do you see? Calculate a Power Regression equation on the two lists. What is the equation?​</a>

                                            How to Win a BattleIt was a beautiful day for the animal and insects in the field. Butterflies hopped from flower toflower. Dragonflies enjoyed flying in the wide rice field.In one big mango tree in the field, there were monkeys proudly making different stunts amongthe branches of the tree. One monkey swayed his body by means of his tail.One of the dragonflies who were watching them was amused. He went near the tree, alighted ona branch and watched the monkey closely."Hey! What are you doing here? Go away from our tree" one monkey told the dragonflyarrogantly.The dragonfly flew away. He told their chief how monkeys treated him.The chief of the dragonflies sent a message to the head of the monkeys. The head of themonkeys was so proud to accept the message. But when he read it, he got mad.Soon a battle was declared between a group of monkeys and a group of dragonflies."Hit hard with your clubs every dragonfly you see. Remember, you are at an advantage, youhave the hands, the feet, the tail and most of all you have the head. Use them to the fullest. Alright,go!" ordered the head of the monkey.Meanwhile, the dragonflies were having a meeting with their chief, too."Remember, alight on the forehead of every monkey you see. Be quick to fly away when you seeanother monkey swinging his club. Alight, go!" the chief of the dragonflies ordered.And the battle began. Each monkey tried to strike a dragonfly stepping on the forehead of hiscomrade. But the dragonflies were quick to fly away before the heavy blow of the club could reachthem. Instead every swing of the club hit the forehead of another monkey.Many of the monkeys died with broken skull. Their foreheads received the blow that shouldhave hit the dragonflies. The leader of the monkeys soon realized that battles are not won byweapons alone. They needed to think carefully and plan very well. They should think and plan wiselyespecially if their enemies are the dragonflies.​</a>

Sewing by hand is a skill that most, if not all people should probably attempt to master at some point. T d 도 - Back Stitch Make one running stitch, then take a back stitch to the beginning of the first stitch, thus overlapping each running stitch. Resembles machine stitching and is used to strengthen a seam made by hand. Basting Basting is quite important in successful sewing. This is used to hold fabric temporarily in place, until permanently stitched There are four types of basting; hand basting machine basting, pin basting and basting edges with an iron. Running Stitch To make this stitch, push point of needle in and out of fabric until you have several stitches on the needle. Hold fabric taut with left hand, pull the needle through. Practice until you make fine even stitches. Outline Stitch This stitch is similar to the back stitch but it is slanted Make one slanted backstitch in front of another letting each one overlap the one before it just a little bit, until the design is filled Blanket Stitch Put your needle in 1/4 inch from the edge of the fabric, put the thread under the point of the needle and pull through بندشدن * Catch Stitch This is used for a flat finish next to fabric, such as seam , binding on a hem. Hold open hem edge away from your world from left to right, Take a stitch in the hem, then a tiny stitch to the right just beyond edge of hem with the point of needle to the left.

                            13. Each lab group should pick up the following from the teacher: scissors tape measure tape single-hole hole punch dark orange or dark red paper (at least 7 by 7cm) flashlight with a well focused emission of light and light end no more than 5 cm in diameter graphing calculator or computer with software to perform a power regression on your data Find a blank, flat wall to shine a light onto and a table or chair that can stabilize the flashlight for this lab. If you have a nice blank wall near the end of a lab table, you can just put the light on top of the table. You will need to be able to move the light (whether along the table or by moving the chair) at least 1 meter in distance closer to or away from the wall. Use the hole punch to punch a hole in the center of the dark orange or dark red paper. Tape the paper to the light end of the flashlight, making sure the hole is roughly centered over the light. Place the flashlight on the chair or table at least 10 cm from the wall. You can adjust it with papers or books so that it is level (i.e., the light beam shines perpendicular on the wall). Measure the distance from the wall to the hole on the front of the flashlight. Record this distance in your data table. Turn the flashlight on. You should see a distinct white circle projected on the wall. The rest of the light emitted outside of this light should be a shade of the colored paper taped to the flashlight. Illustration of the lab set-up Illustration of the lab set-up. (Credit: NASA/Imagine the Universe) Take 3 different measurements of the diameter of the circle of white light on the wall. HINT: Remember, the diameter of a circle is the longest measured chord from one edge of the circle to the other. Therefore, you know you've got the diameter when you hold one end of the tape measure on one side (edge) of the circle and get the largest measured value by moving the other end of the tape measure along the other side. Record these values in the data chart. Calculate the mean and record it as well. Move the chair with the flashlight (or move along the table) about 20 cm further away from the wall. Measure the distance from the wall to the hole on the front of the flashlight. Record this distance on your data table. Repeat steps 6-8 at least two more times. Calculate the radius from each mean diameter. Record each calculation in the data table. Calculate the area of the circle formed from each calculated radius. Record each calculation in the data table. HINT: Area of a circle equals π r2. In your graphics calculator, enter the distance from the hole to the wall as one list and the area of each calculated circle as another list. Plot the data in the lists as a scatter plot. What kind of relationship do you see? Calculate a Power Regression equation on the two lists. What is the equation?​</h2><br />

                        <p>BIG BANG THEORY</p><p>How does big bang theory affect us?</p><p>ANSWER</p><p>Basically, the big bang theory helps us understand how everything started, how the macrocosm or universe formed and how solar system and the Earth itself existed. The big bang affects us everyday, everything we are experiencing today is the physical result or aftereffect of the big bang, and it is not even finished yet, the universe's inflation is still continuously progressing at the speed beyond the speed of light.</p><p></p><p>Big bang is the only "realistic" and acceptable explanation we have, when I say "realistic" it isn't even close to the actual definition of the word "realistic", because even scientists and astronomers are still baffled and not straight up convinced with big bang theory due to some inaccuracies and incomprehensible mysteries. Nonetheless, big bang theory is still the well-held, leading theory of the cosmos's birth, the most accurate visualization and the foundation of all scientific principles.</p><p></p><p>#BrainliestBunch</p><br />

                        1) <strong>An object moves as a result of force. </strong><p>Unless altered by another force, a moving object maintains its constant speed or velocity.</p><p></p><p>Isaac Newton discovered the principles of motion in 1687. He realized that moving an item requires force and that once that object is going, nothing can stop it or make it travel faster or slower than another external force. An object that is not moving will not begin to move until some force is applied to it. This is known as the law of inertia. On Earth, where gravity and friction play a role in moving objects, this and Newton's other laws are difficult to see.</p><p></p>2) Newton’s Three Laws of Motion<strong>LAW 1 </strong>- Nothing occurs until something occurs to it. An item that is neither pushed or pulled either remains stationary or moves in a straight line at a constant pace. Nothing moves unless acted upon by a force. If something is moving, it will continue to move at the same pace and in the same direction unless it is changed by a force.<strong>LAW 2</strong> - Forces accelerate things (or accelerate). <strong>When a force pushes or pulls on an object, it moves in the same direction as the force.</strong> The greater the acceleration, the larger the force and the lighter the object. It can also cause anything to slow down, accelerate, or shift direction.<strong>LAW 3</strong> - Every action has a corresponding and opposing reaction. When a force acts in one direction, it generates an equal and opposing force.<p></p>3) Heavier (more mass) items are more difficult to move and stop. <p>Heavier items (those with a higher mass) are more resistant to change than lighter objects. Pushing a bicycle or a Cadillac, for example, or stopping them once they are moving. The more heavier the thing (the greater its inertia), the more difficult it is to start or stop.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about force here: https://brainly.ph/question/122024</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ3</p><br />

                            28. How to Win a BattleIt was a beautiful day for the animal and insects in the field. Butterflies hopped from flower toflower. Dragonflies enjoyed flying in the wide rice field.In one big mango tree in the field, there were monkeys proudly making different stunts amongthe branches of the tree. One monkey swayed his body by means of his tail.One of the dragonflies who were watching them was amused. He went near the tree, alighted ona branch and watched the monkey closely."Hey! What are you doing here? Go away from our tree" one monkey told the dragonflyarrogantly.The dragonfly flew away. He told their chief how monkeys treated him.The chief of the dragonflies sent a message to the head of the monkeys. The head of themonkeys was so proud to accept the message. But when he read it, he got mad.Soon a battle was declared between a group of monkeys and a group of dragonflies."Hit hard with your clubs every dragonfly you see. Remember, you are at an advantage, youhave the hands, the feet, the tail and most of all you have the head. Use them to the fullest. Alright,go!" ordered the head of the monkey.Meanwhile, the dragonflies were having a meeting with their chief, too."Remember, alight on the forehead of every monkey you see. Be quick to fly away when you seeanother monkey swinging his club. Alight, go!" the chief of the dragonflies ordered.And the battle began. Each monkey tried to strike a dragonfly stepping on the forehead of hiscomrade. But the dragonflies were quick to fly away before the heavy blow of the club could reachthem. Instead every swing of the club hit the forehead of another monkey.Many of the monkeys died with broken skull. Their foreheads received the blow that shouldhave hit the dragonflies. The leader of the monkeys soon realized that battles are not won byweapons alone. They needed to think carefully and plan very well. They should think and plan wiselyespecially if their enemies are the dragonflies.​</h2><br />

                            29. Learning Task 1 Title: Movement and Motion You will need: small ball, toy car, notebook, ruler, large hard bound book (will be used as ramp), marker pen and masking tape What to do: 1. Mark a spot on the floor with a masking tape. Label it as POINT A.2. Place the small ball on point A, then blow on it. 3. Using a ruler, record the distance in centimeters if the ball moved away from POINT A or did not move at all. 4. Place a car toy on POINT A, then blow on it. As much as possible, apply the same amount of force applied on the ball. 5. Using a ruler, record the distance in centimeters if the ball moved away from POINT A or did not move at all. 6. Place a notebook on POINT A, then blow on it with the same amount of force applied to ball and toy car. 7. Using a ruler, record the distance in centimeters if the ball moved away from POINT A or did not move at all. 8. Repeat steps 1 to 7, but this time push the ball, the toy car and the notebook with your fingers. Record your observations. 9. Repeat steps 1 to 7, but this time, one side of the hardbound book as a ramp ( 45 degrees inclination see picture below). Label its highest point as A. Put the ball, toy car and notebook one at a time without applying any force. Observe what will happen to the ball, toy car, and notebook. Record your observations. 10. Make a table like the one below to record your observations. Put a check if there was movement after force was applied. Objects to be Moved Blowing Pushing Placing on a Ramp 1. Ball 2. Toy car 3. notebook Guide Questions: 1. Which action causes all the object moves? 2. Why do you think this action causes movement?3. Which among the objects is the hardest to move? Why do you think is it hardest to move? 4. Which among the objects is the easiest to move? Why do you think it is the easiest to move? 5. What is the importance of Point A in determining the movement of the objects?​</h2><br />

                            30. The cops found a corpse days ago. In the victim's hand, they found a piece of paper. So, here's what's written onto it.I looked down at this dusty stairway,T'was said to have one hundred 'n eighteen count,I took down twenty three steps,Then another ninety steps down,Just a twenty eight more down steps, and I can get away from this building,Yet, I go up sixty three steps while counting,‘Hmm, okay. Gonna get down with 35 steps.’&amp; so I did.Now, I'm at the thirty-third.I went through 19 steps up. I hummed while taking thirty-two steps down.I smirked before I decided to leave this place.I guess you can now tell what my name is?​</h2><br />
