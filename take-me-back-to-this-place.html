                                            Black Beauty (An excerpt) by Anna Sewell The first place that I can remember was a large pleasant meadow. At the top of the meado Was a grove of fir trees. At the bottom was a running brook overhung by a steep bank At first, when I was very young, I always ran by my mother's side. But soon, when I was old enough to eat grass, my mother would go to work in the daytime. I would run with six other colts who lived in the meadow. We had great fun. We used to gallop together round and round the field as fast as we could go. As I grew older and my coat became shinier , many people came to admire me. I had . fine, black coat, one white foot, and a white star on my forehead. I was four years old when the farmer said that it was time to train me to be obedient. The to learn to wear a saddle and a bridle. And I had to carry a person on my back. At first, I hate a it. Soon I became accustomed to it. I was trained to pull a carriage. One day in May, I was sold to Squire Gordon. My mother gave me this advice: "Do your best wherever you are. Keep up your good name. So I came to Birtwick Pass. I was placed in a large loose box. Two other horses were in stalls next to me. Their names were Merrylegs and Ginger. Soon, I became friendly with both of them a “What shall we call him?" Squire Gordon asked his wife. "He's black as pure ebony and quite a beauty. Let's call him Black Beauty," she suggested One day, John, the coach driver, harnessed me to the cart. We would take the squire to town. It had been raining heavily and the wind was blowing hard. The water had flooded the road up to my knees in some places. But we got through to the town. On our way home, we had to cross a low wooden bridge. When I touched the first part of the bridge, I felt sure there was something wrong. I stopped. "Go on, Black Beauty," my master urged. But I dared not go forward. Just then, the keeper of the bridge came running. He was waving a lantern, and shouting "Hey, stop! The bridge is broken in the middle. Part of it is carried away." The squire patted my head. “Dear Beauty, if you had not been so wise, we might have drowned." "You saved us, Beauty!" said John. a 60​</a>

His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</a>

                                            HELP ME PLEASE I HAVE TO SUBMIT IN 3 HOURSOnce apon time, There was a king called Midas in a his kingdom. He was very rich, and he loved gold and all the things that is fancy. But he loved his daughter more than anything. One day, Midas found a poor old man wandering in the streets barefoot, "Hello, You seem lost do you need help?" Midas asked the poor old man. "Yes i am, i have lost my track on my way home. Could you help me young man." The poor old man said. Midas let the poor old man go in his palace and let him stay there until His guards finds the poor old mans home. Midas gave the poor old man clothes, food , a place to stay in and anything the poor old man wants, Until 2 days later a guard found an old shack near the forest. "It must be the poor old mans house." The guard said. The guard come back to the palace and told the king, It was getting dark while midas was guiding the poor old man to his house, Until the poor old man turned into a genie. "Hello young man thank you very much for your good deed, I owe you a wish, wish anything you want young man and i will grant it for you." The genie said. Midas was shocked and gladly said his wish is that whatever he touch would turn into gold. Although the genie said "Are you sure young man?", Midas insisted that the wish was an excellent one, and it was granted! Excitedly, Midas went about touching all sorts of things, turning them into gold. Soon Midas became hungry. He picked up a piece of food, but he couldn't eat it, for it had turned to gold in his hand! "Oh no! My food turned into gold how am i going to eat this? I'm really hungry," said by Midas, "Perhaps this was'nt such a good wish after all!" Midas' beloved daughter, seeing his dismay, she tried to hug him to comfort him, and, she too turned to gold! "The golden touch is no blessing," cried Midas. He went to the river and wept begging to the genie to take his wish back." The genie said "Hello young man, why are you crying?"  "Please take my wish back! Take everything from me except for my beloved daughter! "Midas cried in tears "I see, now you've learned a valuable lesson today,That Gold cannot buy you happiness i can help you turned the things back into normal, Here take this magical potion spray it on the things that turned into gold and it will revert things to normal." The genie said. "Thank you!" Midas happily said in gratitude. And midas sprayed the magical water on everything he turned into gold including his daughter to revert things back to normal. "Now the king and his daughter is living happily ever after.1. what is the title of the story?2. what is the settings of the story?3. who are the characters in the story?4. what is the exposition of the story?5. what is the rising action of the story?6. what is the climax of the story?7. what is the falling action of the story?8. what is the resolution of the story.​</a>

                                            Think again about the story "Captured by Opechancanough."Note that the narrator tells about his travels. A travel account iscalled a journal. The journal of Captain John Smith-a recordof the perils and frustrations of America's first settlers-is oneof the first literature of America."Capture by Opechancanough"              An excerpt           By John SmithWith two Indians for my quides and two of our own company, I set out, leaving seven in the barge. Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​</a>

You last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
(Now I'm in a whole new world with you)
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
A whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you
A whole new world (a whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world (every turn, a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (every moment, red-letter)
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
And then we're home (there's time to spare)
Let me share this whole new world with you
A whole new world (a whole new world)
That's where we'll be (that's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase (a wondrous place)

Are the eventsnarrated in the storyreal?​"Capture by Opechancanough" An excerptBy John SmithWith two Indians for my quides and two of our own company, I set out, leaving seven in the barge. Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​ paki sagot po plsss ​​</a>

Sorry, guys, I have to hit the hay now! The candidate did not look very intelligent, but you can't judge a book by its cover. Ha, that assignment was really a piece of cake! He realized honesty is the best policy and told them what really happened to their car. If you want to be a good writer, you should write every day. Remember, practice makes perfect.

Come, saveme.The villagers heard the shout and ran to help him. But when they reach there, theycould see no lion and the boy was perfectly all right. The boy laughed at the villagers sayingno Lion: I did it only for fun."The villagers got highly annoyed and came back with an air of anger.Few days later the boy repeated the whole act. Again the villagers went to his rescuebut were duped again. Now they decided not to be fooled by him anymore.Unfortunately, one day, the Lion really came there. Now the boy shouted, "Lion!Lion!", as loud as he could. But nobody came to help him out.The lion attacked the boy.

At the bottom was a running brook overhung by a steep bank At first, when I was very young, I always ran by my mother's side. But soon, when I was old enough to eat grass, my mother would go to work in the daytime. I would run with six other colts who lived in the meadow. We had great fun. We used to gallop together round and round the field as fast as we could go. As I grew older and my coat became shinier , many people came to admire me. I had . fine, black coat, one white foot, and a white star on my forehead. I was four years old when the farmer said that it was time to train me to be obedient. The to learn to wear a saddle and a bridle. And I had to carry a person on my back. At first, I hate a it. Soon I became accustomed to it. I was trained to pull a carriage. One day in May, I was sold to Squire Gordon. My mother gave me this advice: "Do your best wherever you are. Keep up your good name. So I came to Birtwick Pass. I was placed in a large loose box. Two other horses were in stalls next to me. Their names were Merrylegs and Ginger. Soon, I became friendly with both of them a “What shall we call him?" Squire Gordon asked his wife. "He's black as pure ebony and quite a beauty. Let's call him Black Beauty," she suggested One day, John, the coach driver, harnessed me to the cart. We would take the squire to town. It had been raining heavily and the wind was blowing hard. The water had flooded the road up to my knees in some places. But we got through to the town. On our way home, we had to cross a low wooden bridge. When I touched the first part of the bridge, I felt sure there was something wrong. I stopped. "Go on, Black Beauty," my master urged. But I dared not go forward. Just then, the keeper of the bridge came running. He was waving a lantern, and shouting "Hey, stop! The bridge is broken in the middle. Part of it is carried away." The squire patted my head. “Dear Beauty, if you had not been so wise, we might have drowned." "You saved us, Beauty!" said John. a 60​</h2><br />

Read the story carefully and do the tasks that follow.WHY DOGS WAG THEIR TAILS(Excerpt: First of Two Parts)(An Adaptation)(1) Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a rich man who had a pet dog andcat. His only daughter whom he adored so much was living in a place several miles away fromhim. It was his custom to send his dog and cat to her daughter and bring her a present. Thedog was a bit old and had pretty much lost some teeth so he was no longer able to fight. But, healways knew how to find the way. The cat on the other hand was strong and shrewd so theycould help the other.(2) One day the rich man wanted to send a magic ring to his daughter. He called the dobgand cat. He said to the cat " You have shown a lot of character such as being shrewd andprudent so you may carry this magic ring to my daughter but you have to make sure to takegreat care of it." He also said to the dog You are to go with the cat to take this magic ring to mydaughter. Take care not to lose the way and be sure that no one bothers the cat'. Both animalspromised to do their best and went on their way.(3) On the way, they were impelled to cross a wide and deep river. They weredetermined to swim across as there was no bridge and they couldn't find a boat. The dog said tothe cat, "You need to hand me the ring;" "Oh no!", replied the cat. "Did you not remember whatthe master said just what each of us had to do?", "Yes, but you are not very good at swimmingso I can better take good care of it." The cat refused to disobey the master until the dogthreatened to kill the cat. He was left with no choice but to hand over the magic ring.(4) They began swimming but the current was so strong. It took them an hour in gettingover so they were both tired and weak. Just as they were about to come to the other side, thedog accidentally dropped the ring into the water and finding it seems impossible. The cat saidNow, we have to go back home and tell our master that we lost the ring". "Yes" answered thedog, "but I am scared". So they went back home. As they drew near the house the dog's fearOverpowered him that he ran away as fast as he could and was never seen again.(5) The master, surprised to see the cat back so soon, asked " Why are you alone?".The cat was a bit scared to answer at first. Where is the dog?" asked the master again, "Oh! Heran away' replied the cat. "Ran away?" said the master, "What do you mean? "Where is thering? Let me tell you what happened but please do not get angry"(5) When we reached the river bank, the doq asked me to hand him the ring, I refused alot of times but he threatened to kill me so I was left with no choice. The current was so strongand we were having a hard time crossing the river; so, on the way the dog dropped the ring andwe couldn't find it anymore"T told the dog to go back and tell you what happened, but he said he was so scaredthat he ran away as fast as he could".(8) With this, the master made a proclamation that whoever finds his old dog and canbring him back will be rewarded. The dog'can easily Be recognized às he was already old andhas no teeth. The master had also declared that the dog will be punished by cutting off his tail.(9) It was ordered that all the dogs shall take part in the search. Eversince, that time,when one dog meets another, he always says, "Are you the old dog who lost the ring?". If youwere that dog, your tail will be cut off. Then both the dogs show their teeth and wag their tailswhich means no. It was also that time when cats have been afraid of water.​</h2><br />

                            16. HELP ME PLEASE I HAVE TO SUBMIT IN 3 HOURSOnce apon time, There was a king called Midas in a his kingdom. He was very rich, and he loved gold and all the things that is fancy. But he loved his daughter more than anything. One day, Midas found a poor old man wandering in the streets barefoot, "Hello, You seem lost do you need help?" Midas asked the poor old man. "Yes i am, i have lost my track on my way home. Could you help me young man." The poor old man said. Midas let the poor old man go in his palace and let him stay there until His guards finds the poor old mans home. Midas gave the poor old man clothes, food , a place to stay in and anything the poor old man wants, Until 2 days later a guard found an old shack near the forest. "It must be the poor old mans house." The guard said. The guard come back to the palace and told the king, It was getting dark while midas was guiding the poor old man to his house, Until the poor old man turned into a genie. "Hello young man thank you very much for your good deed, I owe you a wish, wish anything you want young man and i will grant it for you." The genie said. Midas was shocked and gladly said his wish is that whatever he touch would turn into gold. Although the genie said "Are you sure young man?", Midas insisted that the wish was an excellent one, and it was granted! Excitedly, Midas went about touching all sorts of things, turning them into gold. Soon Midas became hungry. He picked up a piece of food, but he couldn't eat it, for it had turned to gold in his hand! "Oh no! My food turned into gold how am i going to eat this? I'm really hungry," said by Midas, "Perhaps this was'nt such a good wish after all!" Midas' beloved daughter, seeing his dismay, she tried to hug him to comfort him, and, she too turned to gold! "The golden touch is no blessing," cried Midas. He went to the river and wept begging to the genie to take his wish back." The genie said "Hello young man, why are you crying?"  "Please take my wish back! Take everything from me except for my beloved daughter! "Midas cried in tears "I see, now you've learned a valuable lesson today,That Gold cannot buy you happiness i can help you turned the things back into normal, Here take this magical potion spray it on the things that turned into gold and it will revert things to normal." The genie said. "Thank you!" Midas happily said in gratitude. And midas sprayed the magical water on everything he turned into gold including his daughter to revert things back to normal. "Now the king and his daughter is living happily ever after.1. what is the title of the story?2. what is the settings of the story?3. who are the characters in the story?4. what is the exposition of the story?5. what is the rising action of the story?6. what is the climax of the story?7. what is the falling action of the story?8. what is the resolution of the story.​</h2><br />

                            17. Think again about the story "Captured by Opechancanough."Note that the narrator tells about his travels. A travel account iscalled a journal. The journal of Captain John Smith-a recordof the perils and frustrations of America's first settlers-is oneof the first literature of America."Capture by Opechancanough"              An excerpt           By John SmithWith two Indians for my quides and two of our own company, I set out, leaving seven in the barge. Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​</h2><br />

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
(Now I'm in a whole new world with you)
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
A whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you
A whole new world (a whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world (every turn, a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (every moment, red-letter)
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
And then we're home (there's time to spare)
Let me share this whole new world with you
A whole new world (a whole new world)
That's where we'll be (that's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase (a wondrous place)

                            26. Recall the story about "Captured by opechancanough" you havejust read. Who is thenarrator? Is he a realperson? Are the eventsnarrated in the storyreal?​"Capture by Opechancanough" An excerptBy John SmithWith two Indians for my quides and two of our own company, I set out, leaving seven in the barge. Having explored twenty miles further in this desert, I found that the river still kept its depth and breadth, but that it was much more thickly lined with trees.Some twelve miles above the barge, we went ashore to refresh ourselves and to cook our food. One of the Indians 1 took with me to examine the nature of the soil and to cross the bends of the river. The other Indian I left with John Robinson and Thomas Emry, with their matches, light, and with the order that they should discharge a gun for my retreat, at the first sight of any Indian.Within a quarter of an hour, I heard a loud cry and the yelling of Indians, but no warning shot. Supposing my companions were surprised, and that the Indian guides had betrayed us, I seized my guide and found his arm fast to my hand with a garter, with my pistol aimed, ready to take revenge upon him. He advised me to fly and seemed ignorant of what was happening.But as he went on, I was struck with an arrow on the right thigh, without however, being seriously harmed. When this happened, I caught sight of two Indians drawing their bows. I prevented them from shooting by firing my French pistol.By the time I had loaded again, three or four more Indians were making ready to shoot. The first had fallen down or fled. At my next discharge, they shot their arrows. I made barricade of my servant, who offered not to fight Twenty or thirty arrows were shot to me, but fell short. I had discharged my pistol three or four times before. Opechanconough, the king of Pamaunck, with two hundred men, surrounded me. Each drew his bow and then lay it on the ground without shooting,My servant explained that I was the captain. They demanded my arms. The rest they said were slain; only me they would spare. My guide implored me not to shoot. In mak ing for the boat, being in the midst of a low quagmire, and minding the Indians more than my steps, 1 stepped directly into the quagmire,as did my Indian also, in trying to draw me out.Thus surprised. I resolved to try their mercy. I cast my arms from me. Until I did this, none dared to approach me; but now they seized me, drew me out of the quagmire, and led me to the king. I presented him with a compass, describing its use as well as I could, and he was so much amazed that he let me go on with a discourse on the roundness of the Earth, and the course of the sun, moon, stars, and planets.He then paid me back with kind speeches and with bread, and led me to where the cone was, and where John Robinson lay, killed. Emry I did not see.From the great number of fires: all through the woods, I realized that the Indians had been hunting deer. At each place where they stopped, I expected them to execute me as kindly as they could.When we approached their town, which was within six miles of the spot where I was captured, all the women and children who had learned of this event came to meet us. The king was well-guarded by twenty bowmen, five on the Blank and five in the rear, and in each flank in front of him a sword and a gun with the same behind him; then a bowman on either side of me. The rest filed along in the rear, forming a V-shape, each with his bow and a handful of arrows, a quiver, grimly painted, at his back. On each flank was a sergeant, one running constantly toward the front, the other toward the rear, at a regular pace in good order. After this performance had lasted for sometime the warriors rushed into a circle with a dance: and finally each man departed for his lodging. The captain conducted me to his lodging, and gave me for supper a quarter of venison and some ten pounds of bread. What I left was kept for me, and sent with me to my lodging.​ paki sagot po plsss ​​</h2><br />
