Distance is a scalar quantity that refers to how much ground an object hascovered during its motion.________ 12. Displacement is defined as the change in position of an object.________ 13. Speed is the term used to describe travel per unit velocity.________ 14. Velocity describes both intensity and direction.________ 15. Acceleration is the change of velocity and is measured in meters per secondsquared (m/s2) or centimetre per second squared (cm/s2).________ 16. Acceleration is the change of velocity per unit time, then the change in thevelocity (v) is the final velocity (vf) minus the initial velocity (vi).________ 17. If an object is moving at a constant speed, it means it has the same increase indistance in a given time.________ 18. A steeper line indicates a smaller distance moved in a given time.________ 19. Speed-Time graphs are also called Velocity-Time graphs.________ 20. The steeper the graph, the greater the acceleration.</a>

Write the equation: An old woman entered an elevator of a 5 star hotel and wished to reach the ground floor. However, the elevator was being operated by a playful boy at that time. From there, the elevator went 6 floors up, 9 floors down, 12 more floors down, 8 floors up, and 7 floors down. At last, the old woman was able to exit from the elevator at a ground floor. On what floor did the old woman enter the elevator?3. Write the equation: In a basketball championship game, the Tamaraws scored 42 points more than the Blue Eagles.a. If the blue eagles scored x points, express the score of tamaraws in terms of x.b. However, if the blue eagles doubled their efforts, that means, if the Blue eagles scored twice while the tamaraws had the same performance, they would have scored one point more than the Tamaraws. Considering both situations in (a) and (b), give the actual scores of both teams. Please, answer it correctly with a complete solution.</a>

The other way of assessing the impact of an earthquake is to assess what people felt and how much damage was done. 9. Intensity values are assigned to locations, rather than to the earthquake itself, and therefore in- tensity can vary widely, depending on the proximity to the earthquake and the types of materials and conditions of the subsurface. 10. The magnitude is the same no matter where you are, or how strong or weak the shaking was in various locations. 11. Magnitude and intensity of an earthquake can be determined by our own instincts and beliefs.12. PHIVOLCS monitors and records shaking of the ground and ruptures brought by an earthquake. 13. Aftershocks can be felt before a strong shaking. 14. The magnitude scale is open-ended, meaning that scientists have not put a limit on how large an earthquake could be, but there is a limit just from the size of the earth. 15. Scientists use the different speeds of seismic waves to locate the epicenter of earthquakes. pa sagot po ng maayos​</a>

Heat can be transferred in three ways: conduction, convection, andradiation.2. Conduction and convection need a medium (matter) for the heat totransfer from one place to another.3. When heat moves through an object by conduction, it causes the atomsin the object to move slower.4. In convection, heat always move from colder region to hotter region.5. The sun gives us heat energy. The process of transmitting heat from thesun to the Earth is called convection.6. Most of the cooking pans have wooden handles so that the flow of heatwill not reach the handles. It only means that woods are insulators.7. When you place and object to the top a hotter object, heat transfer willtake place from hotter object to colder object.8. If you left a metal spoon in a pot of soup being heated, the temperature ofthe handle of the spoon will stay the same.9. The sun heats the ground through radiation, then the ground heats theair through conduction.10. A cube of ice is placed into the hand of a man. Over time, heat conductedfrom the man's hand to the ice cube will cause the ice to melt. Thisscenario is an example of convection.​</a>

The other way of assessing the impact of an earthquake is to assess what people felt and how much damage was done. 9. Intensity values are assigned to locations, rather than to the earthquake itself, and therefore in- tensity can vary widely, depending on the proximity to the earthquake and the types of materials and conditions of the subsurface. 10. The magnitude is the same no matter where you are, or how strong or weak the shaking was in various locations. 11. Magnitude and intensity of an earthquake can be determined by our own instincts and beliefs.12. PHIVOLCS monitors and records shaking of the ground and ruptures brought by an earthquake. 13. Aftershocks can be felt before a strong shaking. 14. The magnitude scale is open-ended, meaning that scientists have not put a limit on how large an earthquake could be, but there is a limit just from the size of the earth. 15. Scientists use the different speeds of seismic waves to locate the epicenter of earthquakes. pa sagot po ng maayos​</h2><br />

Heat can be transferred in three ways: conduction, convection, andradiation.2. Conduction and convection need a medium (matter) for the heat totransfer from one place to another.3. When heat moves through an object by conduction, it causes the atomsin the object to move slower.4. In convection, heat always move from colder region to hotter region.5. The sun gives us heat energy. The process of transmitting heat from thesun to the Earth is called convection.6. Most of the cooking pans have wooden handles so that the flow of heatwill not reach the handles. It only means that woods are insulators.7. When you place and object to the top a hotter object, heat transfer willtake place from hotter object to colder object.8. If you left a metal spoon in a pot of soup being heated, the temperature ofthe handle of the spoon will stay the same.9. The sun heats the ground through radiation, then the ground heats theair through conduction.10. A cube of ice is placed into the hand of a man. Over time, heat conductedfrom the man's hand to the ice cube will cause the ice to melt. Thisscenario is an example of convection.​</h2><br />
