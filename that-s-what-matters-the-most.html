                                            Seismic waves are known as earthquake waves. There are types of seismic waves. Primary waves, Secondary waves and Surface waves. Primary waves also called P-waves) travel the fastest of all the waves. They are unique in the aspect that they travel through all states of matter solid, liquid, and gas. P-waves are considered push-pull waves. They push and pull the rock on the contrary, secondary waves (also called as S-waves) are not as fast as P- waves. They cannot travel through liquid or gas. S-waves travel in a side-to- side motion Surface waves (also called as L-waves) are the slowest wave. They move along the earth's surface similar to the way waves travel in the ocean, up and down. They are the most destructive wave because of the danage they create directly on to the earth's surface. As the waves reach the core, one kind of seismic wave (S-wave) disappears. That means that the outer core is liquid. Seismic Wave Another Name Speed Motion Type of Material it travels Primary Wave 1. 2. 3. Solid, Liquid and Gas the the S-wave 5. 6. Average speed L-wave 8.

This is the most common terminology that describes how Filipinos welcome foreigners or tourists who visit the country. This trait of the Filipinos towards their visitors is undeniably exceptional. Whenever a visitor stays in a Filipino home, there will be a feast or a grand celebration as it is somehow a tradition for us to prepare bountiful Filipino cuisine for guests to have a taste of our culture through food. In addition, a cheerful family would typically be ready to accommodate and spend time with the visitors. To add to that, Filipino families are often more than willing to share not only their meals but their entire home as well. As a matter of fact, Filipinos would usually greet their visitors with the phrase "Feel at home!" to ensure that they are at ease during their stay. For Filipinos, it is a pleasure and the country's honor to accept foreigners as visitors and build genuine relationships and friendships with them. Indeed, this clearly shows that Filipinos are a warm and loving people. They give and share what they have for their guest even it means a little sacrifice on their part. But have they ever wondered and pondered on this question? Are they carrying the Filipinos' hospitality to the extremes? Now, it's your turn! Use the outline below to write an informative essay about a Filipino trait of your choice. You may use a separate sheet of paper for your answer.

                                            Equal Partnership in Marriage
What are the benefits to men? Men benefit emotionally from equal partnership
because there is greater openness and they feel better about their marriage. They
all benefit from the greater physical intimacy that comes with equal partnership.
Physical closeness improves physical health and reduces stress. Men in happy
marriages also are more productive at work, because they are less distracted by
concerns at home.
What about the benefits to women? The closer communication and emotional
intimacy in an equal partnership greatly benefit women. Research shows that having
equal say in decision making is the most important contributor to wives’ view of their
marriages as happy and satisfying. Wives are happier when their husbands
appreciate them for work they do in the home and when their husbands are
copartners in domestic matters. They feel better about themselves, are less angry
or depressed, feel their relationship is more equitable, and are happier with their
marriage.
 In conclusion, taking into account mutual respect, learning from others, and
adaptation to modern times, the opinion of the “woman” domestic chores should
change to the “partnership” domestic chores.

Physical changes are those that do not change the make-upor identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay.Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does not change the matter's identity. Chemicalchanges turn the matte into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper isburnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physicalre temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which methe state of matter.​</a>

                            6. Seismic waves are known as earthquake waves. There are types of seismic waves. Primary waves, Secondary waves and Surface waves. Primary waves also called P-waves) travel the fastest of all the waves. They are unique in the aspect that they travel through all states of matter solid, liquid, and gas. P-waves are considered push-pull waves. They push and pull the rock on the contrary, secondary waves (also called as S-waves) are not as fast as P- waves. They cannot travel through liquid or gas. S-waves travel in a side-to- side motion Surface waves (also called as L-waves) are the slowest wave. They move along the earth's surface similar to the way waves travel in the ocean, up and down. They are the most destructive wave because of the danage they create directly on to the earth's surface. As the waves reach the core, one kind of seismic wave (S-wave) disappears. That means that the outer core is liquid. Seismic Wave Another Name Speed Motion Type of Material it travels Primary Wave 1. 2. 3. Solid, Liquid and Gas the the S-wave 5. 6. Average speed L-wave 8.

This is the most common terminology that describes how Filipinos welcome foreigners or tourists who visit the country. This trait of the Filipinos towards their visitors is undeniably exceptional. Whenever a visitor stays in a Filipino home, there will be a feast or a grand celebration as it is somehow a tradition for us to prepare bountiful Filipino cuisine for guests to have a taste of our culture through food. In addition, a cheerful family would typically be ready to accommodate and spend time with the visitors. To add to that, Filipino families are often more than willing to share not only their meals but their entire home as well. As a matter of fact, Filipinos would usually greet their visitors with the phrase "Feel at home!" to ensure that they are at ease during their stay. For Filipinos, it is a pleasure and the country's honor to accept foreigners as visitors and build genuine relationships and friendships with them. Indeed, this clearly shows that Filipinos are a warm and loving people. They give and share what they have for their guest even it means a little sacrifice on their part. But have they ever wondered and pondered on this question? Are they carrying the Filipinos' hospitality to the extremes? Now, it's your turn! Use the outline below to write an informative essay about a Filipino trait of your choice. You may use a separate sheet of paper for your answer.

                            13. Equal Partnership in Marriage
What are the benefits to men? Men benefit emotionally from equal partnership
because there is greater openness and they feel better about their marriage. They
all benefit from the greater physical intimacy that comes with equal partnership.
Physical closeness improves physical health and reduces stress. Men in happy
marriages also are more productive at work, because they are less distracted by
concerns at home.
What about the benefits to women? The closer communication and emotional
intimacy in an equal partnership greatly benefit women. Research shows that having
equal say in decision making is the most important contributor to wives’ view of their
marriages as happy and satisfying. Wives are happier when their husbands
appreciate them for work they do in the home and when their husbands are
copartners in domestic matters. They feel better about themselves, are less angry
or depressed, feel their relationship is more equitable, and are happier with their
marriage.
 In conclusion, taking into account mutual respect, learning from others, and
adaptation to modern times, the opinion of the “woman” domestic chores should
change to the “partnership” domestic chores.

Here are four steps to help solve any math problems easily: (1) Read carefully, understand, and identifythe type of problem. (2) Draw and review your problem. (3) Develop the plan to solve it. (4)Solve the problem39. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical andphysical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-upor identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay.Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does not change the matter's identity. Chemicalchanges turn the matte into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper isburnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physicalre temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which methe state of matter.​</h2><br />

I will love you as we find ourselves farther and farther from one another, where we once we were so close that we could slip the curved straw, and the long, slender spoon, between our lips and fingers respectively.I will love you until the chances of us running into one another slip from slim to zero, and until your face is fogged by distant memory, and your memory faced by distant fog, and your fog memorized by a distant face, and your distance distanced by the memorized memory of a foggy fog. I will love you no matter where you go and who you see, no matter where you avoid and who you don’t see, and no matter who sees you avoiding where you go. I will love you no matter what happens to you, and no matter how I discover what happens to you, and no matter what happens to me as I discover this, and now matter how I am discovered after what happens to me as I am discovering this.Where is this from?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Development of atomic theory</p><p>The concept of the atom that Western scientists accepted in broad outline from the 1600s until about 1900 originated with Greek philosophers in the 5th century BCE. Their speculation about a hard, indivisible fundamental particle of nature was replaced slowly by a scientific theory supported by experiment and mathematical deduction. It was more than 2,000 years before modern physicists realized that the atom is indeed divisible and that it is not hard, solid, or immutable.</p><p></p><p>The atomic philosophy of the early Greeks</p><p>Leucippus of Miletus (5th century BCE) is thought to have originated the atomic philosophy.
