                            18. Do the following activity and answer the question that follows: Get something to eat from your kitchen, chew it slowly then swallow 1. What did you do to the food inside your mouth? think it passes? 2. After chewing the food what do you feel when you swallow it? Where do you 3. When the food is already in your stomach, what do you think will happen? 4. Do you think there will be changes in the food when it gets through the small intestine? 5. Do you think the large intestine gets food the same way? Why?​</h2><br />
                        <p>1. Food enters the digestive system through the mouth. Food is broken down into smaller pieces by chewing. The teeth cut and crush the food, while it's mixed with saliva. This process helps to make it soft and easier to swallow.</p><p></p><p>What will happen to the undigested food?</p><p>From the small intestine, undigested food (and some water) travels to the large intestine through a muscular ring or valve that prevents food from returning to the small intestine. By the time food reaches the large intestine, the work of absorbing nutrients is nearly finished.</p><p></p><p>2. After you chew and swallow your food, it enters your esophagus. This tube connects your throat to your stomach. A series of muscular contractions, known as peristalsis, pushes your food downward and into your stomach.</p><p></p><p>3. Once filled with food, the stomach grinds and churns the food to break it down into small particles. It then pushes the small particles of food into the first part of the small intestine, called the duodenum. The small intestine is where most of the digestion and absorption of our food takes place.</p><p></p><p>4.  sorry I don't know about this one</p><p></p><p>5. The large intestine is much broader than the small intestine and takes a much straighter path through your belly, or abdomen. The purpose of the large intestine is to absorb water and salts from the material that has not been digested as food, and get rid of any waste products left over.</p><p></p><p>hope it helps, sorry if I'm wrong </p><br />
