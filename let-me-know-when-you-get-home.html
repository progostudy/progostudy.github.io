The Story of Maria Sinukuan
Once upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit
trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed
this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit
trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and the animals was no
other than Mariang Sinukuan. These fruit trees and animals, Mariang Sinukuan
used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to
see at their doorsteps fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was
Mariang Sinukuan who left this foods while they were sleeping. How grateful the
people were to be graced by the enchanted lady. And to show their gratitude and
respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people
considered her home as a sacred place.
But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no
longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted
to get more.
One day, some young men decided to go up Mt. Arayat. They wanted to
get more of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. They started for the
mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise.
Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate
branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big fruits they
bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one’s reach. Fowls of every kind were
plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were
still viewing this wonder of nature when from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan.
They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not find any words to say to her.
It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them.
” Welcome to my home, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as
you can but I’m warning you not to take anything home without my knowledge.”
With this, the enchanted lady departed.
After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits.
They ate and ate until they could not eat any more.
“Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which I brought,” said one.
“No, let’s not do that. Let’s go home now,” said another. “I’m scared.”
” Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?”
” But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge.”
“Oh, come on. She won’t know we took home fruits and animals. They’re so
plentiful, she won’t know the difference.”
And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and
animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were
about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn’t
mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load
was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men
were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They
remembered Mariang Sinukuan’s warning. The young men became terribly
frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry
them. But before they reached the base of the mountain whom did they see
blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry.
“You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me.
You are not satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even
try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I’m going to turn you all into a
swine.” With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men
into swine.
This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang
Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. Again and again they tried to steal them. At last,
fed up with the people’s greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at
their doorsteps. She caused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to
disappear. She no longer showed herself to the people for she was disgusted
with their greediness.</a>

We "read between the lines" by making inferences about what is not said based on what is said. Read the excerpt from Little Women by Louisa May Alcott and answer the questions that follow. "Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents," grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. "It's so dreadful to be poor!" sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress. "I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all," added little Amy, with an injured sniff. "We've got Father and Mother, and each other," said Beth contentedly from her corner. The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as jo said sadly, "We haven't got Father, and shall not have him for a long time." She didn't say "perhaps never," but each silently added it, thinking of Father far away, where the fighting was. Nobody spoke for a minute, then Meg said in an altered tone, "You know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone, and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't," and Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted. "But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want to buy Undine and Sintran for myself. I've wanted it so long," said Jo, who was a bookworm. "I planned to spend mine in new music," said Beth, with a little sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder. "I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need them," said Amy decidedly. "Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it," cried Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner. "I know I do-teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I'm longing to enjoy myself at home," began Meg, in the complaining tone again. "You don't have half such a hard time as I do," said Jo. "How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to fly out the window or cry? "It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross, and my hands get so stiff, I can't practice well at all."

3. Isabel and Karen are neighbors and at the same time are friends. They are both grade six pupils and study in Pitpitan Elementary School located at Pitpitan, Bulakan, Bulacan. This place is very strict when it comes to safety protocols like wearing face mask and face shield, social distancing and not allowing minors to go out in their house. It is to ensure that the residents here are protected from COVID-19. 14 
One morning, Isabel saw Karen leaving their house. “Karen, where are you going?” asked Isabel. “I will go to school and get my modules,” answered Karen. Isabel told her that children like them are not allowed to go out in the house especially going to school to get the module, but Karen ignored her. A barangay official saw her. Then the following day, the whole barangay was reminded about not allowing minors to go out their house.

                                            Hating Kapatid By: Raissa Rivera Falgui Hating Kapatid My big brother and I come home from school together. A delicious snack always awaits us at home. Today, it's Bibingka that Nanay bought for us Yummy! Nanay kissed us and told us to sit down." You're in charge of dividing the food", she told my brother, "and remember share like brother and sister." The bibingka was cut into four. My brother got three pieces while I got one. "I'm bigger and hungrier. I need more food." He's really bigger than me so I didn't say anything Once, Nanay made fried bananas I helped her cut four bananas in half before she cooked them, so there were eight pieces. My brother got six. "This is how to share like brother and sister", he told me The same thing happened when Tatay brought home our favorite buko pie. When Nanay made a cake and when we had a dozen little rice cakes for our meryenda if someone gave us a mountain of candy, I bet I would only get two or three pieces. My classmate Dina is better off. She has no brothers or sisters. She doesn't have to share anything. If she wanted to. she could eat a whole bibingka or buko pie or cake! But one day, Dina had nothing to eat. She forgot her food at home. "Would you like half of my sandwich?" I offered. I divided it carefully and gave her half. "You did that so carefully. It looks like we are sharing like sisters"." Oh no, both halves are exactly the same," I said. I don't think Dina knows how brothers and sisters share. After all, she doesn't have any. Once, Dina invited me to her house "I have no one to play with at home", she said. We had fun playing hopscotch in front of her house. When her daddy come, he had mamon with him. "Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest. The two of you can just share it." He said. "You divide it. Let's share it like sisters." Dina said. I think she doesn't know how sisters are supposed to share! But how do we do it? We are the same age. We are the same height (she's just a little bit chubbier). "Let's not share like sister" I said. "We're friends. Let's share like friends. "Dina laughed. "What do you mean? Here, let's just do this. You divide it, and I'll choose which half I want. "My hands shook as I carefully divided the mamon in half. Dina looked at the pieces. "It looks like they are the same. So, sharing like sisters is the same as sharing like friends." Then her mommy came home. "Have you had your meryenda?" she asked as she brought out her present-sapin sapin! I had to go home already, so she put sapin-sapin in a small bilao and gave it to me. Tatay was not yet home when I arrived. Nanay was cooking dinner. My brother looked hungry because he was waiting at the dining table. I placed the sapin-sapin in the middle of the table. "Let's share," I said. I got a knife and cut the sapin-sapin in half. Then I cut in half again. "Here, Kuya" I said and gave him one piece. "My friend Dina told me that's how brother and sister are supposed to share. "His eyes grew round, and his face turned red. "Your friend is right, that's how brother and sister are supposed to share," he said in a small voice. I felt like I was bigger and older than my brother. "Maybe we should just share like family," I said. I set aside one piece. "This is for Nanay. "And this is for Tatay" he said. I felt happy because everyone got to try sapin-sapin. It made me happy to make my family happy.​</a>

Take these laser cuffs off" The captain and the guard looked at one another hesitantly Boom! The ship skidded off a large asteroid, "Now! Take the cuffs off! There's no time! Vance shouted at the man. The captain gave the guard a slight nod. The guard waved the magnetic lay over the laser cuffs on Vance's wrists. The cuffs powered down and fell off of Vance's wrists. Suddenly Vance had full control of his arms again. Vance tested the movement of his arms by disarming the guard and slapping the laser cuffs on him in one swift motion.

                                            what's the main idea and the supporting details of this motivational speech?pa help po flsss--------------------------------------------------------------------I'm thinking of two men from Chicago They are both quite successfulSimilar background Educated, they worked for a corporation for many years and they were in the group of people who were fired Two people who were very good friends One went to look for work for several weeks next to the other and they are disappointed and reject them again and again They could not find any workOne of them stopped, was discouraged stopped looking for work, he stayed at home watching television He became a fighter and toxic guy with his wife Drinking beer, talking on the phone with his other negative and unemployed friends And he gave up The other guy kept looking for work in every place he could, every opportunity that was presented to him, he kept asking for work Making contacts, checking the newspapers every dayHe kept going to every place he could trying to get a job And they said "you have a lot of education, you are overqualified, you will not last long" He kept introducing himself to every opportunity He went to a place and said: "Look, I tell you what, if you can not hire me and I know that you can use my talents, abilities and skills " "I do not want to stay at home doing anything, just let me do some volunteer work" "You do not have to give me anything in return, okay? I just want to work and be busy" And they responded, "ok, it's your responsibility, but do not expect me to give you anything in return" This guy came and worked hard, he was the first to arrive and the last to leaveHe was the best employee in the place At 4 weeks one of the managers above resigned And they were looking for a replacement, guess who they chose? This guy, this person who volunteered his time He got the job What was the difference between the two friends? Sight and vision Vista means judging based on what you seeJudge based on appearances But vision means how you interpret what you see The first guy said: "It's not possible, it's over, it's over, I can not do it, I can not do it" He gave up "I faced rejection over and over and over again, I'm not going to go anymore, there's no work" But this other guy, he felt that despite the "NO" and the rejections, despite the bad economy, despite what the newspapers say believe that it is possibleThat someone somewhere will give him work He went ahead thinking it was possible And guess what ladies and gentlemen, that's what we have to do with our dreams Because things happen in our lives that we never but never can anticipate and when those things happen, you want to give up Never let anyone tell you you can not do something​</a>

                                            The Harvest That Never CameA long time ago, the Swedish and Danish people were great friends, which was just as well, as their countries were next to each other. Arild Ugerup was the son of a noble Danish family He had a sweetheart, Thale Thott, and they planned to marry soon. But before the couple could make the arrangements, King Erik of Sweden declared war on the Danish people and Arild was captured. Poor Arild was thrown into a dark prison cell and left there alone. He greatly missed his home, his family, and his sweetheart Thale. Arild wondered whether he would ever get to see them again. Then one day, his jailer handed him a letterMy dearest Arild,You know how much I miss you and wish that I could be with you, even for just one hour. Now, I must bring you bad news. My father wants me to marry soon and he says that, as there is no chance of your coming home, I must marry a nobleman from the next village. I fear I will never see you again, dear Arild. It is a terrible thing, but I must obey my father.Your sweetheart,Thale ThottArild was infuriated at what he read. He threw himself at the bolts of the prison door and shook the bars of his prison windows. In his desperation, he even tried to dig a way out through the floor. "If only I were stronger, I could break out of here and go to Thale." That night when he had calmed down, he thought of a better way to do things. "I'll never be strong enough to break out of here. But I can find a way out using my mind." Dipping his pen in an inkwell, he began to write Your Majesty,I know that I am your prisoner. But for the sake of the friendship between us, grant this boon. I have a sweetheart who I must marry soon or stand losing her. I beg Your Majesty to let me go home to marry her. I will stay only as long as it takes to plant and harvest a crop---for it would not be right to leave my wife as soon as we are married. I solemnly swear that after harvesting the crop, I will come straight back to prison. Before long, King Erik's consent came. All went according to Arild's plan. Thale and him were married. Spring, the time for planting, arrived. In a few short months, Arild would have to harvest his crop and return to captivity To stall his return, he thought long and hard on which crop to plant. Then, he went out to the fields and planted each seed of his chosen crop six footsteps apart. Months passed and the once-green leaves shriveled and turned brown. A messenger arrived to escort Arild back to his prison cell. "The King has kept his part of the bargain. Now it is time for you to keep yours, Arild Ugerup," he told Arild. "But my crop has not even sprouted yet, much less been harvested!" The messenger was astounded at this reply. "Not yet sprouted! What in the world did you plant?" "Pine trees." The messenger rushed back to King Erik's court and relayed all that had happened to His Majesty. Upon hearing Arild's cunning, rhe king laughed. "Such a man does not deserve to remain a prisoner!"And Arild stayed with the wife he had fought for so hard. And around his land, a lush green forest attest to his devotion to her.1. If you were Arild, how would you feel after reading Thale's letter? What conflicts does he face?________________________________________________________________2. Why do you think King Erik agreed to the request?________________________________________________________________3.

Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
(Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?) Uh, But
Come into the light, the triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day
What's that sound? (Oh, oh)
I think it's everyone in town
Hey
Lay down your load (lay down your load)
We are only down the road (we are only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream when we work as a team (all of you, all of you)
You're so strong
Yeah, but sometimes I cry (all of you, all of you)
So do I
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go
The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you
Oh
Hey Mariano, why so blue?
I just have so much love inside
You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment, so would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you (and I hear you)
Yes (all of you, all of you)
Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn
You're the real gift, kid, let us in
Open your eyes
Abre los ojos
What do you see?
I see me
All of me</a>

                                            thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.

I just want to work and be busy" And they responded, "ok, it's your responsibility, but do not expect me to give you anything in return" This guy came and worked hard, he was the first to arrive and the last to leaveHe was the best employee in the place At 4 weeks one of the managers above resigned And they were looking for a replacement, guess who they chose? This guy, this person who volunteered his time He got the job What was the difference between the two friends? Sight and vision Vista means judging based on what you seeJudge based on appearances But vision means how you interpret what you see The first guy said: "It's not possible, it's over, it's over, I can not do it, I can not do it" He gave up "I faced rejection over and over and over again, I'm not going to go anymore, there's no work" But this other guy, he felt that despite the "NO" and the rejections, despite the bad economy, despite what the newspapers say believe that it is possibleThat someone somewhere will give him work He went ahead thinking it was possible And guess what ladies and gentlemen, that's what we have to do with our dreams Because things happen in our lives that we never but never can anticipate and when those things happen, you want to give up Never let anyone tell you you can not do something​</a>

                                            The Story of Mariang SinukuanOnce upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and Sinukuan used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to see at their doorstep's fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was Mariang Sinukuan who left these foods And to show their gratitude and respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people considered her home as a sacred place. But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted to get more. One day, some young men decided to go up mt. Arayat. They wanted to get more of Mariang Sinukuan's fruits and animals. They started for the mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise. Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big ruits they bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one's reach. Fowls of every kind were plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were still viewing this wonder of nature vhen from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan. They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not End any words to say to her. It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them." Welcome to my ome, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as you can but I'm warning you not to ake anything home without my knowledge.” With this, the enchanted lady departed.After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits. They ate and ate until they could not eat any more. "Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which brought," said one. "No, let's not do that. Let's go home now," said another. "I'm scared." " Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?" But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge." "Oh, come on. She won't know we took home fruits and animals. They're so plentiful, she won't know the difference." And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn't mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They remenbered Mariang Sinukuan's warning. The young men became terribly frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry them. But before they reached the base of the mountain, who did they see blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry. "You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me. You are inot satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I'm going to turn you all into a swine." With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men into swine. This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang Sinukuan's fruits and animals. Again, and again they tried to steal them. At last, ed up with the people's greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at their doorsteps. She aused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to disappear. She no longer showed herself to e people for she was disgusted with their greediness.1. If you were Mariang Sinukuan, would you give them the same punishment?2. What are the values can we get or learn from the story of mariang sinukuan? ​pahelp po pls ng maayos na sagot ty. </a>

CAST
Pedro : Father
Sepa : Mother
Gardo : Eldest son (20 yrs. old)
Efren : Son in Manila (17 yrs. old)
Ninay : Youngest daughter (12 yrs. old)
Delia : Another daughter (15 yrs. old)
Iking : Mailman
Iking : Good morning, is anybody home?
Ninay : Good morning, Mang Iking!
Iking : Oh, Ninay! I didn’t see you right away.
Ninay : I was standing behind the bushes. That is why you didn’t see me. Is there any letter for us, Mang Iking?
Iking : Yes. Here’s a letter for your father. It must be from your brother Efren. It came from Manila. Here. Take it.
Ninay : Thank you, Mang Iking. I will give this to Father. I’m sure he will be glad to receive news from Kuya Efren. He has been away for more than a month already and we miss him very much.
Iking : He is now studying in Manila, isn’t he?
Ninay : Yes. He wants to be an engineer and I’m sure he will be someday!
Iking : Alright, I have to leave now. I still have a lot of letters to deliver. Goodbye, Ninay.
Ninay
Later. . . : Goodbye, Mang Iking. Thank you again!
Ninay : Mother asked me to bring your lunch, Father.
Pedro : Where is she? I thought she’d bring lunch herself.
Ninay : Ka Tonyo fetched her. His wife is about to give birth. And they need mother to help deliver the baby. Where’s Kuya Gardo? Isn’t he with you?
Pedro : He went to the stream to get some water. Here he comes now.
Ninay : I really must leave now or I will be late for school, Father.
Pedro : Then better hurry along. Be careful, though.
Ninay : Yes, I will be careful. Oh, I almost forgot!
Pedro : What?
Ninay : I have a letter here for you. Mang Iking gave it to me. Here, Father.
Ninay : Goodbye.
Gardo : Shall we eat now, Father?
Pedro : Later, Gardo. Read this letter to me first because I left my reading glasses at home.
Gardo : This must have come from Efren.
Pedro : How do you know?
Efren : “... and I want so much to go back home. The only thing that sustains me in my loneliness is the thought that someday, I will be able to help you lift our family from the poverty we have endured for so long. I shall always be grateful to you, Father.”
Efren : “Please give my love to Mother, Delia, Ninay and Kuya Gardo. You are always on my mind and in my heart...”
Sepa : “. . . Efren.” He is such a good son.
Pedro : Yes. (softly) Efren is a good son, Sepa.
Sepa : Now, tell me why you were angry when you came home from the fields, Pedro. Do you have a problem?
Pedro : Problem? Oh, no. I don’t have a problem. Let’s just say that there was a little miscommunication earlier. But that has been corrected now.

I found myself blindsided by
A feeling that I've never known
I'm dealing with it on my own
Phone is quiet, walls are bare
I drink myself to sleep, who cares?
No one even has to know
I'm dealing with it on my own
I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody help, it's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time?
Heavy thoughts when it gets late
Put me in a fragile state
I wish I wasn't going home
Dealing with it on my own
I'm praying but it's not enough
I'm done, I don't believe in love
Learning how to let it go
Dealing with it on my own

The Story of Maria Sinukuan
Once upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit
trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed
this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit
trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and the animals was no
other than Mariang Sinukuan. These fruit trees and animals, Mariang Sinukuan
used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to
see at their doorsteps fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was
Mariang Sinukuan who left this foods while they were sleeping. How grateful the
people were to be graced by the enchanted lady. And to show their gratitude and
respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people
considered her home as a sacred place.
But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no
longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted
to get more.
One day, some young men decided to go up Mt. Arayat. They wanted to
get more of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. They started for the
mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise.
Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate
branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big fruits they
bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one’s reach. Fowls of every kind were
plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were
still viewing this wonder of nature when from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan.
They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not find any words to say to her.
It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them.
” Welcome to my home, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as
you can but I’m warning you not to take anything home without my knowledge.”
With this, the enchanted lady departed.
After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits.
They ate and ate until they could not eat any more.
“Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which I brought,” said one.
“No, let’s not do that. Let’s go home now,” said another. “I’m scared.”
” Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?”
” But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge.”
“Oh, come on. She won’t know we took home fruits and animals. They’re so
plentiful, she won’t know the difference.”
And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and
animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were
about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn’t
mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load
was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men
were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They
remembered Mariang Sinukuan’s warning. The young men became terribly
frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry
them. But before they reached the base of the mountain whom did they see
blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry.
“You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me.
You are not satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even
try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I’m going to turn you all into a
swine.” With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men
into swine.
This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang
Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. Again and again they tried to steal them. At last,
fed up with the people’s greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at
their doorsteps. She caused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to
disappear. She no longer showed herself to the people for she was disgusted
with their greediness.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>        Once upon a time there was a girl named Mariang Sinukuan. She lived in Mt. Arayat that abounded in all kinds of fruit and trees and all kinds of animals roamed around there. Mariang Sinukuan helps the peolple there by giving fruits and animals and that gains their respect for her. But one day, some young men decided to go up Mt. Arayat to get more of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. Mariang Sinukuan saw them and told them to eat as much as they can but don't take anything home without her knowledge but they did not obey her instead they fill their sacks with fruits and animals making Mariang Sinukuan angry and punish by turning them into a swine. This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang Sinukuan’s fruits and animals. They tried to steal them and because of that she stopped leaving food at</p><p>their doorsteps. And eventually hide herself together with the fruit and animals from the people for she was disgusted with their greediness.</p><br />

                            6. Inference: 6th Grade Remember that inferencing is when you use the details from a text to come to a conclusion that is not explicitly stated in the text. We "read between the lines" by making inferences about what is not said based on what is said. Read the excerpt from Little Women by Louisa May Alcott and answer the questions that follow. "Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents," grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. "It's so dreadful to be poor!" sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress. "I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all," added little Amy, with an injured sniff. "We've got Father and Mother, and each other," said Beth contentedly from her corner. The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as jo said sadly, "We haven't got Father, and shall not have him for a long time." She didn't say "perhaps never," but each silently added it, thinking of Father far away, where the fighting was. Nobody spoke for a minute, then Meg said in an altered tone, "You know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone, and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't," and Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted. "But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want to buy Undine and Sintran for myself. I've wanted it so long," said Jo, who was a bookworm. "I planned to spend mine in new music," said Beth, with a little sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder. "I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need them," said Amy decidedly. "Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it," cried Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner. "I know I do-teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I'm longing to enjoy myself at home," began Meg, in the complaining tone again. "You don't have half such a hard time as I do," said Jo. "How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to fly out the window or cry? "It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross, and my hands get so stiff, I can't practice well at all." And Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time. "I don't believe any of you suffer as I do," cried Amy, "for you don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice."

His mother is a fish vendor and his father is a fisherman. No one could assist him. In answering his module, he does everything he can. Once his parents arrived home from work, he let them to check his work and ask those items he could not understand. 
One morning, Alex finds his Math lesson difficult, he tried all the possible ways he knows to get the answer but still his answer is wrong. He feels hopeless. He suddenly thought of calling his teacher Elsa to ask him about the said lesson. He was happy because his teacher was able to help him. “Next time Alex, if you need help, you may call me again,” said Teacher Elsa. “Thank you, Teacher Elsa,” Alex replied.

3. Isabel and Karen are neighbors and at the same time are friends. They are both grade six pupils and study in Pitpitan Elementary School located at Pitpitan, Bulakan, Bulacan. This place is very strict when it comes to safety protocols like wearing face mask and face shield, social distancing and not allowing minors to go out in their house. It is to ensure that the residents here are protected from COVID-19. 14 
One morning, Isabel saw Karen leaving their house. “Karen, where are you going?” asked Isabel. “I will go to school and get my modules,” answered Karen. Isabel told her that children like them are not allowed to go out in the house especially going to school to get the module, but Karen ignored her. A barangay official saw her. Then the following day, the whole barangay was reminded about not allowing minors to go out their house. 
a. Be a good friend to others.

                            11. Hating Kapatid By: Raissa Rivera Falgui Hating Kapatid My big brother and I come home from school together. A delicious snack always awaits us at home. Today, it's Bibingka that Nanay bought for us Yummy! Nanay kissed us and told us to sit down." You're in charge of dividing the food", she told my brother, "and remember share like brother and sister." The bibingka was cut into four. My brother got three pieces while I got one. "I'm bigger and hungrier. I need more food." He's really bigger than me so I didn't say anything Once, Nanay made fried bananas I helped her cut four bananas in half before she cooked them, so there were eight pieces. My brother got six. "This is how to share like brother and sister", he told me The same thing happened when Tatay brought home our favorite buko pie. When Nanay made a cake and when we had a dozen little rice cakes for our meryenda if someone gave us a mountain of candy, I bet I would only get two or three pieces. My classmate Dina is better off. She has no brothers or sisters. She doesn't have to share anything. If she wanted to. she could eat a whole bibingka or buko pie or cake! But one day, Dina had nothing to eat. She forgot her food at home. "Would you like half of my sandwich?" I offered. I divided it carefully and gave her half. "You did that so carefully. It looks like we are sharing like sisters"." Oh no, both halves are exactly the same," I said. I don't think Dina knows how brothers and sisters share. After all, she doesn't have any. Once, Dina invited me to her house "I have no one to play with at home", she said. We had fun playing hopscotch in front of her house. When her daddy come, he had mamon with him. "Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest. The two of you can just share it." He said. "You divide it. Let's share it like sisters." Dina said. I think she doesn't know how sisters are supposed to share! But how do we do it? We are the same age. We are the same height (she's just a little bit chubbier). "Let's not share like sister" I said. "We're friends. Let's share like friends. "Dina laughed. "What do you mean? Here, let's just do this. You divide it, and I'll choose which half I want. "My hands shook as I carefully divided the mamon in half. Dina looked at the pieces. "It looks like they are the same. So, sharing like sisters is the same as sharing like friends." Then her mommy came home. "Have you had your meryenda?" she asked as she brought out her present-sapin sapin! I had to go home already, so she put sapin-sapin in a small bilao and gave it to me. Tatay was not yet home when I arrived. Nanay was cooking dinner. My brother looked hungry because he was waiting at the dining table. I placed the sapin-sapin in the middle of the table. "Let's share," I said. I got a knife and cut the sapin-sapin in half. Then I cut in half again. "Here, Kuya" I said and gave him one piece. "My friend Dina told me that's how brother and sister are supposed to share. "His eyes grew round, and his face turned red. "Your friend is right, that's how brother and sister are supposed to share," he said in a small voice. I felt like I was bigger and older than my brother. "Maybe we should just share like family," I said. I set aside one piece. "This is for Nanay. "And this is for Tatay" he said. I felt happy because everyone got to try sapin-sapin. It made me happy to make my family happy.​</h2><br />

                            20. The Harvest That Never CameA long time ago, the Swedish and Danish people were great friends, which was just as well, as their countries were next to each other. Arild Ugerup was the son of a noble Danish family He had a sweetheart, Thale Thott, and they planned to marry soon. But before the couple could make the arrangements, King Erik of Sweden declared war on the Danish people and Arild was captured. Poor Arild was thrown into a dark prison cell and left there alone. He greatly missed his home, his family, and his sweetheart Thale. Arild wondered whether he would ever get to see them again. Then one day, his jailer handed him a letterMy dearest Arild,You know how much I miss you and wish that I could be with you, even for just one hour. Now, I must bring you bad news. My father wants me to marry soon and he says that, as there is no chance of your coming home, I must marry a nobleman from the next village. I fear I will never see you again, dear Arild. It is a terrible thing, but I must obey my father.Your sweetheart,Thale ThottArild was infuriated at what he read. He threw himself at the bolts of the prison door and shook the bars of his prison windows. In his desperation, he even tried to dig a way out through the floor. "If only I were stronger, I could break out of here and go to Thale." That night when he had calmed down, he thought of a better way to do things. "I'll never be strong enough to break out of here. But I can find a way out using my mind." Dipping his pen in an inkwell, he began to write Your Majesty,I know that I am your prisoner. But for the sake of the friendship between us, grant this boon. I have a sweetheart who I must marry soon or stand losing her. I beg Your Majesty to let me go home to marry her. I will stay only as long as it takes to plant and harvest a crop---for it would not be right to leave my wife as soon as we are married. I solemnly swear that after harvesting the crop, I will come straight back to prison. Before long, King Erik's consent came. All went according to Arild's plan. Thale and him were married. Spring, the time for planting, arrived. In a few short months, Arild would have to harvest his crop and return to captivity To stall his return, he thought long and hard on which crop to plant. Then, he went out to the fields and planted each seed of his chosen crop six footsteps apart. Months passed and the once-green leaves shriveled and turned brown. A messenger arrived to escort Arild back to his prison cell. "The King has kept his part of the bargain. Now it is time for you to keep yours, Arild Ugerup," he told Arild. "But my crop has not even sprouted yet, much less been harvested!" The messenger was astounded at this reply. "Not yet sprouted! What in the world did you plant?" "Pine trees." The messenger rushed back to King Erik's court and relayed all that had happened to His Majesty. Upon hearing Arild's cunning, rhe king laughed. "Such a man does not deserve to remain a prisoner!"And Arild stayed with the wife he had fought for so hard. And around his land, a lush green forest attest to his devotion to her.1. If you were Arild, how would you feel after reading Thale's letter? What conflicts does he face?________________________________________________________________2. Why do you think King Erik agreed to the request?________________________________________________________________3.

Why do you think the author starts the story with the letter that you read along with arild?________________________________________________________________​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. If you were Arild, how would you feel after reading Thale's letter? What conflicts does he face?</p><p></p><p><strong>If I were Arild, I would feel devastated and heartbroken after reading Thale's letter. I would also feel frustrated and angry that I am unable to be with Thale due to being imprisoned. The conflict Arild faces is the struggle to balance his love for Thale and his duty to return to prison as promised.</strong></p><p></p><p>2. Why do you think King Erik agreed to the request?</p><p></p><p><strong>King Erik may have agreed to the request because he values the friendship between him and Arild and wants to show mercy and compassion towards Arild. He may also have seen the request as an opportunity to demonstrate his generosity and kindness.</strong></p><p></p><p>3. Do you think Arild was a true friend to King Erik?</p><p></p><p><strong>Arild demonstrated his loyalty and respect towards King Erik by asking for his permission and keeping his promise to return to prison after planting and harvesting a crop. This shows that Arild values the friendship between them and is willing to abide by the rules set by King Erik. Therefore, I believe Arild was a true friend to King Erik.</strong></p><p></p><p>4. Why do you think the author starts the story with the letter that you read along with Arild?</p><p></p><p><strong>The author may have started the story with the letter that the reader reads along with Arild to immediately introduce the conflict and emotions involved in the story. The letter also serves as a catalyst for Arild's actions and decisions throughout the story. By starting with the letter, the author also allows the reader to empathize with Arild and understand his motivations and feelings.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn
You're the real gift, kid, let us in
Open your eyes
Abre los ojos
What do you see?
I see me

                            23. thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.

                            27. The Story of Mariang SinukuanOnce upon a time, they say that Mt. Arayat abounded in all kinds of fruit trees. Aside from the fruit trees, it is said that animals of all kinds once roamed this mountain. The strange thing about this fruit trees and animals is that the fruit trees bore exceptionally big fruits all the year round and Sinukuan used to distribute to the poor. Needy families often woke up on the morning to see at their doorstep's fruits and animals for their needs. They knew it was Mariang Sinukuan who left these foods And to show their gratitude and respect they never tried to go to her hide-out in the mountain. The people considered her home as a sacred place. But such was not always the case. There came a time when the people were no longer satisfied with what the enchanted lady left at their doorsteps. They wanted to get more. One day, some young men decided to go up mt. Arayat. They wanted to get more of Mariang Sinukuan's fruits and animals. They started for the mountain early at dawn. They reached the base of the mountain at sunrise. Guavas bigger than their fists dangled from the guava trees. Pomegranate branches almost reached to the ground because of the many and big ruits they bore. Ripe mangoes were just within one's reach. Fowls of every kind were plentiful. Pigs, goats and other animals roamed around. The young men were still viewing this wonder of nature vhen from nowhere came Mariang Sinukuan. They were dazzled by her brilliance. They could not End any words to say to her. It was Mariang Sinukuan who first spoke to them." Welcome to my ome, young men. Help yourself to the fruits. Eat as much as you can but I'm warning you not to ake anything home without my knowledge.” With this, the enchanted lady departed.After recovering from their amazement, the young men started to pick up fruits. They ate and ate until they could not eat any more. "Let us pick some more fruits. I want to fill this sack which brought," said one. "No, let's not do that. Let's go home now," said another. "I'm scared." " Why be scared? Did we not come to get more fruits and animals?" But the lady warned us not to take anything home without her knowledge." "Oh, come on. She won't know we took home fruits and animals. They're so plentiful, she won't know the difference." And so the young men started to fill their sacks with as many fruits and animals as they could get hold of. Then they started for home. As they were about to begin their descent they felt their sacks becoming heavier. They didn't mind this, but they had not gone ten steps farther when they felt that their load was pulling them down. Putting the sacks down, how surprised the young men were to find that the fruits and animals had become big stones. They remenbered Mariang Sinukuan's warning. The young men became terribly frightened. Leaving their sacks behind, they ran as fast as their feet could carry them. But before they reached the base of the mountain, who did they see blocking their way? It was Mariang Sinukuan who was very angry. "You ungrateful wretches! I help you in times of need. But how do you repay me. You are inot satisfied with what I leave you at your doorsteps. And now you even try to steal my things! Because of your greediness I'm going to turn you all into a swine." With the wave of her wand, Mariang Sinukuan changed the young men into swine. This was not the last time that people tried to get hold of Mariang Sinukuan's fruits and animals. Again, and again they tried to steal them. At last, ed up with the people's greediness, Mariang Sinukuan stopped leaving food at their doorsteps. She aused the fruit trees and animals in the mountain to disappear. She no longer showed herself to e people for she was disgusted with their greediness.1.

Iking : Yes. Here’s a letter for your father. It must be from your brother Efren. It came from Manila. Here. Take it.
Ninay : Thank you, Mang Iking. I will give this to Father. I’m sure he will be glad to receive news from Kuya Efren. He has been away for more than a month already and we miss him very much.
Iking : He is now studying in Manila, isn’t he?
Ninay : Yes. He wants to be an engineer and I’m sure he will be someday!

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The letter is from Efren, the son who is studying in Manila, and it contains his message of love and gratitude towards his family, particularly his father who has endured poverty for so long.The eldest son, Gardo, interpreted the letter positively and with a proud tone of voice. He was not jealous of his brother and instead, he seemed to admire Efren's dedication to his studies and his desire to help lift their family from poverty.The mother, Sepa, interpreted the letter with a loving and emotional tone of voice. She expressed her admiration for Efren's character and considered him a good son. While not all mothers may react in the same way, it is common for parents to feel proud and emotional when receiving messages from their children who are away from home.Both interpretations are valid and can be considered close to Efren's intention. The letter expresses Efren's love and gratitude towards his family, as well as his determination to succeed and help his family overcome poverty. It is possible that Efren intended to convey both the positive emotions and the message of hope for a better future that his family can have with his success.Both interpretations are likable, as they show different perspectives and emotions that can arise from reading a letter from a loved one who is far away. However, the interpretation that focuses on Efren's determination to succeed and help his family can be particularly inspiring and hopeful for others who may also be struggling with poverty or other challenges in their lives.<p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>google nyo po para malaman mo</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>CONSTELLATION<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A <strong>constellation</strong> is a region on the divine circle where a gathering of noticeable stars frames an apparent framework or example, commonly addressing a creature, legendary individual or animal, or a lifeless thing.
</p><p>
</p><p>The beginnings of the most punctual <strong>constellations </strong>probably return to ancient times. Individuals utilized them to relate accounts of their convictions, encounters, creation, or folklore. Various societies and nations embraced their own <strong>constellations</strong>, some of which endured into the mid twentieth century before the present <strong>constellations </strong>were universally perceived. The acknowledgment of <strong>constellations</strong> has changed altogether after some time. Many changed in size or shape. Some became famous, just to drop into lack of definition. Some were restricted to a solitary culture or country.
</p><p>
</p><p>The 48 conventional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in Aratus' work Peculiarities and Ptolemy's Almagest, however their starting point presumably originates before these works by a few centuries. <strong>Constellations</strong> in the far southern sky were added from the fifteenth century until the mid-eighteenth century when European wayfarers started going toward the Southern Half of the globe. Twelve old <strong>constellations </strong>have a place with the zodiac. The beginnings of the zodiac remain generally dubious; its mysterious divisions became noticeable c. 400 BC in Babylonian or Chaldean cosmology.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What is a constellation? - Brainly.ph

I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody help, it's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time?
Heavy thoughts when it gets late
Put me in a fragile state
I wish I wasn't going home
Dealing with it on my own
I'm praying but it's not enough
I'm done, I don't believe in love
Learning how to let it go
Dealing with it on my own
I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody help, it's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark
Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time? Yeah
I drive circles under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
Get this out my head, so
I drive, chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget
