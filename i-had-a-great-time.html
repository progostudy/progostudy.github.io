Soon I found out I had cancer
I was once told
That the key to life
Was to live each moment
As if it was your last
As soon as I was diagnosed
I did just that
I always spoke out for what was right
Even if it caused a fight
I had a life well lived
With 3 children and a husband
I believe it was my time to go
Therefor I am writing this so
I hope my legacy soon lives on
And brings a great influence upon"

I hoped that I answered the math problems right. During recess, I accompanied my bestfriend Leah in the canteen. We had a good time sharing our thoughts about the exam. At 10:00 a.m, we went to our science laboratory for our experiment. I really enjoyed studying mixtures. I had lunch in our classroom together with Leah and my other friends. In the afternoon, we had a roleplaying in Filipino. I played the grandmother's role. It was funny because I had to make my voice sound like that of an old woman's. My Monday was really great.

Was to live each moment
As if it was your last

We had a good time sharing our thoughts about the exam. At 10:00 a.m, we went to our science laboratory for our experiment. I really enjoyed studying mixtures. I had lunch in our classroom together with Leah and my other friends. In the afternoon, we had a roleplaying in Filipino. I played the grandmother's role. It was funny because I had to make my voice sound like that of an old woman's. My Monday was really great. Love, CarlaWords that tell time123456Words that tell place123456</h2><br />
