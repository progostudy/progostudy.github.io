                    <p>I am a student of the National University in Manila. I was only in my first year.
As a student I have an observed appreciation of virtue (CORE
VALUES) Like Respect for the elderly when you say &quot;Po and OOpo&quot; respect for each other
classmate&#039;s decision Respect for school law. As a nationalian I was
trustworthy such as not cheating on exams Telling the truth and being diligent.
Because I see other N.U. students cleaning outside the University. As a
student, it&#039;s not easy either because you have to pass a lot of exams
memorize and study so that you can pass every science. I see the unity of each
National because in one class there are different courses such as Marketing, HRM and others
pa. You can see in them that they get along well with every project of our school. I remember
when I was new to this school I got lost and asked my neighbor
student where my classroom immediately he immediately accompanied me to my room and me
thanked him.Even if there is leftovers in a room it doesn’t disappear like that
I witnessed I saw a cellphone charged in the room I did not move it
so did my classmates because they knew they didn’t return it immediately by the owner and
thanked us and the one I dropped my i.d and wallet I was crying before but there was
knocked on our classroom and introduced that he had picked up my i.d and wallet to my delight
I know there are still such people in the world because most people today can be exploited. .
My experience shows that students here can be trusted with ours
school. The teachers here at N.U. are kind and we can’t leave the classroom without
we have deep knowledge or lessons I learn a lot as a good student.
I believe that youth is the hope of the people. I can make it through
study hard, and avoid vice or any evil deeds such as gambling.
I will also strive to be a good example to my fellow youth. I totally believe
that the simple and small ways I do it is a big help in the development of
country I belong to. Whatever hardship I can bear do not despair
every test as a student many people will actually pull you down but confident
only self is needed, diligence, Perseverance and never forget the faith in us
Dear Lord he will help us and
will guide. The year is fast approaching now let&#039;s just strive as a good and
diligent students we will not realize that we will be able to finish school and
one day we will succeed in the life we ​​face.

He ordered them to bring in a bundle of sticks, and said tohis eldest son: "Break it." The son strained and strained, but with all his efforts wasunable to break the sticks. The other sons also tried, but none of them was successful."Untie the bundle," said the father, "and each of you take a stick."

He ordered them to bring in a bundle of sticks, and said tohis eldest son: "Break it." The son strained and strained, but with all his efforts wasunable to break the sticks. The other sons also tried, but none of them was successful."Untie the bundle," said the father, "and each of you take a stick." When they haddone so, he called out to them: "Now, break," and each stick was easily broken. "Yousee my meaning. "said their father.4.

                                            Cosette Side by Side with the Stranger in the DarkCosette, as we have said, was not frightened.The man accosted her. He spoke in a voice that was grave and almost bass.“My child, what you are carrying is very heavy for you.”Cosette raised her head and replied:﻿—“Yes, sir.”“Give it to me,” said the man; “I will carry it for you.”Cosette let go of the bucket-handle. The man walked along beside her.“It really is very heavy,” he muttered between his teeth. Then he added:﻿—“How old are you, little one?”“Eight, sir.”“And have you come from far like this?”“From the spring in the forest.”“Are you going far?”“A good quarter of an hour’s walk from here.”The man said nothing for a moment; then he remarked abruptly:﻿—“So you have no mother.”“I don’t know,” answered the child.Before the man had time to speak again, she added:﻿—“I don’t think so. Other people have mothers. I have none.”And after a silence she went on:﻿—“I think that I never had any.”The man halted; he set the bucket on the ground, bent down and placed both hands on the child’s shoulders, making an effort to look at her and to see her face in the dark.Cosette’s thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky.“What is your name?” said the man.“Cosette.”The man seemed to have received an electric shock. He looked at her once more; then he removed his hands from Cosette’s shoulders, seized the bucket, and set out again.After a moment he inquired:﻿—“Where do you live, little one?”“At Montfermeil, if you know where that is.”“That is where we are going?”“Yes, sir.”He paused; then began again:﻿—“Who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest?”“It was Madame Thénardier.”The man resumed, in a voice which he strove to render indifferent, but in which there was, nevertheless, a singular tremor:﻿—“What does your Madame Thénardier do?”“She is my mistress,” said the child. “She keeps the inn.”“The inn?” said the man. “Well, I am going to lodge there tonight. Show me the way.”“We are on the way there,” said the child.The man walked tolerably fast. Cosette followed him without difficulty. She no longer felt any fatigue. From time to time she raised her eyes towards the man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence. She had never been taught to turn to Providence and to pray; nevertheless, she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy, and which mounted towards heaven.Several minutes elapsed. The man resumed:﻿—“Is there no servant in Madame Thénardier’s house?”“No, sir.”“Are you alone there?”“Yes, sir.”Another pause ensued. Cosette lifted up her voice:﻿—“That is to say, there are two little girls.”“What little girls?”“Ponine and Zelma.”This was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the female Thénardier.“Who are Ponine and Zelma?”“They are Madame Thénardier’s young ladies; her daughters, as you would say.”“And what do those girls do?”“Oh!” said the child, “they have beautiful dolls; things with gold in them, all full of affairs. They play; they amuse themselves.”“All day long?”“Yes, sir.”“And you?”“I? I work.”“All day long?”The child raised her great eyes, in which hung a tear, which was not visible because of the darkness, and replied gently:﻿—“Yes, sir.”After an interval of silence she went on:﻿—“Sometimes, when I have finished my work and they let me, I amuse myself, too.”“How do you amuse yourself?”“In the best way I can. They let me alone; but I have not many playthings. Ponine and Zelma will not let me play with their dolls. I have only a little lead sword, no longer than that.”The child held up her tiny finger.“And it will not cut?”“Yes, sir,” said the child; “it cuts salad and the heads of flies.”They reached the village. Cosette guided the stranger through the streets. They passed the bakeshop, but Cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch. The man had ceased to ply her with questions, and now preserved a gloomy silence.When they had left the church behind them, the man, on perceiving all the open-air booths, asked Cosette:﻿—“So there is a fair going on here?”“No, sir; it is Christmas.”As they approached the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm:﻿—“Monsieur?”“What, my child?”“We are quite near the house.”“Well?”“Will you let me take my bucket now?”“Why?”“If Madame sees that someone has carried it for me, she will beat me.”The man handed her the bucket. An instant later they were at the tavern door.​</a>

                            1. I am a student of the National University in Manila. I was only in my first year.
As a student I have an observed appreciation of virtue (CORE
VALUES) Like Respect for the elderly when you say "Po and OOpo" respect for each other
classmate's decision Respect for school law. As a nationalian I was
trustworthy such as not cheating on exams Telling the truth and being diligent.
Because I see other N.U. students cleaning outside the University. As a
student, it's not easy either because you have to pass a lot of exams
memorize and study so that you can pass every science. I see the unity of each
National because in one class there are different courses such as Marketing, HRM and others
pa. You can see in them that they get along well with every project of our school. I remember
when I was new to this school I got lost and asked my neighbor
student where my classroom immediately he immediately accompanied me to my room and me
thanked him.Even if there is leftovers in a room it doesn’t disappear like that
I witnessed I saw a cellphone charged in the room I did not move it
so did my classmates because they knew they didn’t return it immediately by the owner and
thanked us and the one I dropped my i.d and wallet I was crying before but there was
knocked on our classroom and introduced that he had picked up my i.d and wallet to my delight
I know there are still such people in the world because most people today can be exploited. .
My experience shows that students here can be trusted with ours
school. The teachers here at N.U. are kind and we can’t leave the classroom without
we have deep knowledge or lessons I learn a lot as a good student.
I believe that youth is the hope of the people. I can make it through
study hard, and avoid vice or any evil deeds such as gambling.
I will also strive to be a good example to my fellow youth. I totally believe
that the simple and small ways I do it is a big help in the development of

                            3. dear MamaYou are appreciatedWhen I was young, me and my mama had beefSeventeen years old, kicked out on the streetsThough back at the time I never thought I'd see her faceAin't a woman alive that could take my mama's placeSuspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a foolWith the big boys breakin' all the rulesI shed tears with my baby sister, over the yearsWe was poorer than the other little kidsAnd even though we had different daddies, the same dramaWhen things went wrong we'd blame MamaI reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hellHuggin' on my mama from a jail cellAnd who'd think in elementary, heyI'd see the penitentiary one day?And runnin' from the police, that's rightMama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backsideAnd even as a crack fiend, MamaYou always was a black queen, MamaI finally understandFor a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a manYou always was committedA poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did itThere's no way I can pay you backBut the plan is to show you that I understandYou are appreciatedLady, don't you know we love you? (Dear Mama)Sweet lady, place no one above you (You are appreciated)Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fairNo love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't thereHe passed away and I didn't cry, 'cause my angerWouldn't let me feel for a strangerThey say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all alongI was lookin' for a father, he was goneI hung around with the thugsAnd even though they sold drugsThey showed a young brother loveI moved out and started really hangin'I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocksIt feels good puttin' money in your mailboxI love payin' rent when the rent's dueI hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you'Cause when I was low you was there for meAnd never left me alone, because you cared for meAnd I could see you comin' home after work lateYou're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plateYou just workin' with the scraps you was givenAnd Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'But now the road got rough, you're aloneYou're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your ownAnd there's no way I can pay you backBut my plan is to show you that I understandYou are appreciatedLady, don't you know we love you? (And dear Mama)Sweet lady, place no one above you (You are appreciated)Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?Pour out some liquor and I reminisce'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mamaAnd when it seems that I'm hopelessYou say the words that can get me back in focusWhen I was sick as a little kidTo keep me happy there's no limit to the things you didAnd all my childhood memoriesAre full of all the sweet things you did for meAnd even though I act crazyI gotta thank the Lord that you made meThere are no words that can express how I feelYou never kept a secret, always stayed realAnd I appreciate how you raised meAnd all the extra love that you gave meI wish I could take the pain awayIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter dayEverything will be alright if you hold onIt's a struggle every day, gotta roll onAnd there's no way I can pay you backBut my plan is to show you that I understandYou are appreciatedLady, don't you know we love you?

                            7. Cosette Side by Side with the Stranger in the DarkCosette, as we have said, was not frightened.The man accosted her. He spoke in a voice that was grave and almost bass.“My child, what you are carrying is very heavy for you.”Cosette raised her head and replied:﻿—“Yes, sir.”“Give it to me,” said the man; “I will carry it for you.”Cosette let go of the bucket-handle. The man walked along beside her.“It really is very heavy,” he muttered between his teeth. Then he added:﻿—“How old are you, little one?”“Eight, sir.”“And have you come from far like this?”“From the spring in the forest.”“Are you going far?”“A good quarter of an hour’s walk from here.”The man said nothing for a moment; then he remarked abruptly:﻿—“So you have no mother.”“I don’t know,” answered the child.Before the man had time to speak again, she added:﻿—“I don’t think so. Other people have mothers. I have none.”And after a silence she went on:﻿—“I think that I never had any.”The man halted; he set the bucket on the ground, bent down and placed both hands on the child’s shoulders, making an effort to look at her and to see her face in the dark.Cosette’s thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky.“What is your name?” said the man.“Cosette.”The man seemed to have received an electric shock. He looked at her once more; then he removed his hands from Cosette’s shoulders, seized the bucket, and set out again.After a moment he inquired:﻿—“Where do you live, little one?”“At Montfermeil, if you know where that is.”“That is where we are going?”“Yes, sir.”He paused; then began again:﻿—“Who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest?”“It was Madame Thénardier.”The man resumed, in a voice which he strove to render indifferent, but in which there was, nevertheless, a singular tremor:﻿—“What does your Madame Thénardier do?”“She is my mistress,” said the child. “She keeps the inn.”“The inn?” said the man. “Well, I am going to lodge there tonight. Show me the way.”“We are on the way there,” said the child.The man walked tolerably fast. Cosette followed him without difficulty. She no longer felt any fatigue. From time to time she raised her eyes towards the man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence. She had never been taught to turn to Providence and to pray; nevertheless, she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy, and which mounted towards heaven.Several minutes elapsed. The man resumed:﻿—“Is there no servant in Madame Thénardier’s house?”“No, sir.”“Are you alone there?”“Yes, sir.”Another pause ensued. Cosette lifted up her voice:﻿—“That is to say, there are two little girls.”“What little girls?”“Ponine and Zelma.”This was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the female Thénardier.“Who are Ponine and Zelma?”“They are Madame Thénardier’s young ladies; her daughters, as you would say.”“And what do those girls do?”“Oh!” said the child, “they have beautiful dolls; things with gold in them, all full of affairs. They play; they amuse themselves.”“All day long?”“Yes, sir.”“And you?”“I? I work.”“All day long?”The child raised her great eyes, in which hung a tear, which was not visible because of the darkness, and replied gently:﻿—“Yes, sir.”After an interval of silence she went on:﻿—“Sometimes, when I have finished my work and they let me, I amuse myself, too.”“How do you amuse yourself?”“In the best way I can. They let me alone; but I have not many playthings. Ponine and Zelma will not let me play with their dolls. I have only a little lead sword, no longer than that.”The child held up her tiny finger.“And it will not cut?”“Yes, sir,” said the child; “it cuts salad and the heads of flies.”They reached the village. Cosette guided the stranger through the streets. They passed the bakeshop, but Cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch. The man had ceased to ply her with questions, and now preserved a gloomy silence.When they had left the church behind them, the man, on perceiving all the open-air booths, asked Cosette:﻿—“So there is a fair going on here?”“No, sir; it is Christmas.”As they approached the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm:﻿—“Monsieur?”“What, my child?”“We are quite near the house.”“Well?”“Will you let me take my bucket now?”“Why?”“If Madame sees that someone has carried it for me, she will beat me.”The man handed her the bucket. An instant later they were at the tavern door.​</h2><br />

But, on secondthought, he took it home and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold.Every morning the same thing occurred, and he soon became rich by selling his eggs as he grew rich he grew greedy and thinking to get at once all the gold the goose give he killed it and opened it only to find nothing.8.the fir tree and the bramble a fir tree said boastingly to the bramble you are useful for nothing at all while i am everywhere use for roofs and houses the bramble answered you pull creator if you would only call to mind the axes and saws which are about to hew you down you would have reason to wish that you had grown up a bramble not a fir tree 9. the monkey and the cookies a monkey put his hand into a jar of cookies.he grassed as many as he could possibly hold but , when he tried to pull out his hand he was prevented from doing so by the neck of the cookie jar.unwilling to lose the cookies and yet unnable to withdraw his hands .he burst into tears and bitterly lamented his dissapointment.10.the crow and the pitcher a crow perishing with thirst saw a pitcher and hoping to find water,flew to eat with delight when he reached it he discover to his grief that it contained so little water that he could not possibly get at it . he tried everything he could think of to reach the water but all his efforts were in vain . at last he collected as many stone as he could carry and drop them one by one with his beak in the pitcher ,until he brought the water within his reach and thus saved his life.a. there is strength in unityb. it is better to be called a fool quietly than to open your mouth and confirm suspicions c.try and try until you succedd.those who do the least work complain the most.e. you cannot always change someones nature by helping him or her.f.dont be greedyg.do not attempt the impossibleh.think throught the risks before following youre insicts i.popularity can be a bad thing j.appreciate what you havek.books are best friends.​</h2><br />

                            9. Cosette, as we have said, was not frightened.The man accosted her. He spoke in a voice that was grave and almost bass."My child, what you are carrying is very heavy for you."Cosette raised her head and replied:--"Yes, sir.""Give it to me," said the man; "I will carry it for you."Cosette let go of the bucket-handle. The man walked along beside her."It really is very heavy," he muttered between his teeth. Then he added:--"How old are you, little one?""Eight, sir.""And have you come from far like this?""From the spring in the forest.""Are you going far?""A good quarter of an hour's walk from here."The man said nothing for a moment; then he remarked abruptly:--"So you have no mother.""I don't know," answered the child.Before the man had time to speak again, she added:--"I don't think so. Other people have mothers. I have none."And after a silence she went on:--"I think that I never had any."The man halted; he set the bucket on the ground, bent down and placed both hands on the child's shoulders, making an effort to look at her and to see her face in the dark.Cosette's thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky."What is your name?" said the man."Cosette."The man seemed to have received an electric shock. He looked at her once more; then he removed his hands from Cosette's shoulders, seized the bucket, and set out again.After a moment he inquired:--"Where do you live, little one?""At Montfermeil, if you know where that is.""That is where we are going?""Yes, sir."He paused; then began again:--"Who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest?""It was Madame Thenardier."The man resumed, in a voice which he strove to render indifferent, but in which there was, nevertheless, a singular tremor:--"What does your Madame Thenardier do?""She is my mistress," said the child. "She keeps the inn.""The inn?" said the man. "Well, I am going to lodge there to-night. Show me the way.""We are on the way there," said the child.The man walked tolerably fast. Cosette followed him without difficulty. She no longer felt any fatigue. From time to time she raised her eyes towards the man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence. She had never been taught to turn to Providence and to pray; nevertheless, she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy, and which mounted towards heaven.Several minutes elapsed. The man resumed:--"Is there no servant in Madame Thenardier's house?""No, sir.""Are you alone there?""Yes, sir."Another pause ensued. Cosette lifted up her voice:--"That is to say, there are two little girls.""What little girls?""Ponine and Zelma."This was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the female Thenardier."Who are Ponine and Zelma?""They are Madame Thenardier's young ladies; her daughters, as you would say.""And what do those girls do?""Oh!" said the child, "they have beautiful dolls; things with gold in them, all full of affairs. They play; they amuse themselves.""All day long?""Yes, sir.""And you?""I? I work.""All day long?"The child raised her great eyes, in which hung a tear, which was not visible because of the darkness, and replied gently:--"Yes, sir."After an interval of silence she went on:--"Sometimes, when I have finished my work and they let me, I amuse myself, too.""How do you amuse yourself?""In the best way I can. They let me alone; but I have not many playthings. Ponine and Zelma will not let me play with their dolls. I have only a little lead sword, no longer than that."The child held up her tiny finger."And it will not cut?""Yes, sir," said the child; "it cuts salad and the heads of flies."They reached the village. Cosette guided the stranger through the streets. They passed the bakeshop, but Cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch. The man had ceased to ply her with questions, and now preserved a gloomy silence.When they had left the church behind them, the man, on perceiving all the open-air booths, asked Cosette:--"So there is a fair going on here?""No, sir; it is Christmas."As they approached the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm:--"Monsieur?""What, my child?""We are quite near the house.""Well?""Will you let me take my bucket now?""Why?""If Madame sees that some one has carried it for me, she will beat me."The man handed her the bucket. An instant later they were at the tavern door.​</h2><br />
