                                            WORKSHEET #.1 IN ENGLISH 9Prejudice refers to a preconceived opinion or feeling toward a person based solely on their affiliation with a group. This feelingmay be translated into action by discriminating against the person or members of the target group. An individual may beprejudiced against others based on factors such as race, age, gender, sexual crientation, class status, religion, nationality, andamongst other thingsExaniples:a) "I don't want Blacks living in my neighborhood!"b) "I don't want Jews owning businesses in my town!"c) "I don't want a Muslim community center in lower Manhattan!"These examples clearly show that there are prejudices going on. The statements prejudge against black people, Jews, andMuslims basically because of their race, nationality and religion Even though they have not done anything wrong yet, but becauseof their backgrounds, people tend to prejudge them and eventually discriminate them. These are very common in our society evenup to the present time.Another term that causes confusion and is often used interchangeably with "prejudice" is "bias". But these two termsdiffer from each other. Let's examine how it differs from the formerBias is a tendency to lean in a certain direction, either in favor of or against a particular thing. To be truly biased meansto lack a neutral viewpoint on a particular topic. Somewhere along the line, bias took on a negative connotation. If you're biasedtoward something, then you lean favorably toward it; you tend to think positively of it. Meanwhile, if you're biased againstsomething, then you lean negatively against it; you tend to think poorly of it.Examples:a) In other Christian sects, the preacher position is only given to niales and not to females.b) Sectarian schools only accept students who share the same religious beliefs.c) Sonie churches don't accept women who wear pants instead of dresses or skirts during their services.In the given examples, a certain group or people is given favor than the other. In number one, males are given morerower or authority than females. Number two, students who are interested to study in a school but don't share the same religioncan't be admitted. And lastly, women who want to attend church services aren't allowed to go if they don't wear the prescribedclothes for the said servicesANSWER THE FOLLOWING:Study and evaluate whether the given scenarios contain biases and prejudices. Write bias, prejudice, or none.1. Some Muslims are assumed to be terrorists and eventually being discriminated.2. Jews during the period of 'Hitler were sentenced to death because Hitler himself despised Jewish people.3. A teacher who gives good rating to her student who shares the same religious belief with her4. A married couple living in a new country where they are free to attend to any of their church services5. Tom Cruise's affiliation with Scientology prompts all kinds of negative press6. Not hiring someone because of their age or gender.7. Assuming someone is gay because of the way he acts.8. Bullying and discriminating someone with disability,9 Accepting exclusive me nbership of clubs where certain people are not allowed.10.

                                            OPENING OF THE PANAMA CANAL The Panama Canal was officially opened yesterday when a large vessel of the War Department, the Ancon, went through from ocean to ocean. The event was celebrated locally–it was a public holiday along the isthmus–and from New Orleans and other cities interested in the canal and expecting to use it and profit by it, congratulatory telegrams poured in. The big affair will not come for several months. It has been expected and arranged for that every maritime nation should send some of its crack men-of-war to take part in a great naval parade through the canal next year, and naval displays were proposed for New York, New Orleans and San Francisco. Invitations had been extended to all countries, and even Switzerland had been asked to have some vessel as its representative at Panama. What the celebration will be in the face of present European conditions it is impossible to say. It may be confined to our own fleet and that of our immediate neighbors. Even if the war is ended the chances are against such an international display as had been planned and as that attending the opening of the Suez Canal. Europe will be tired out, with no fever of festival and no desire for naval demonstrations. In the meanwhile, although the canal is now open, and vessels can operate through it, the government will continue to improve, to deepen it for larger vessels, and to make it wider, especially at the Culebra cut, which has been the most difficult portion of the canal from the very beginning. Because of the European trouble and the generally demoralized condition of the world’s merchant marine, the canal will not be used for commerce at the start to the extent that we had hoped for, and it will not be fair to take the first few months’ record as giving any idea what it will do. It is probable that a very large amount of the steamship tonnage going through the canal will be American coastwise vessels running between our Pacific and the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. It is gratifying to know that these vessels will include one or more lines from New Orleans, so that this city will get the share of the canal business it has expected. While there may be some slight disappointment over the fact that the canal was completed during a period of war, when it will not receive the attention it deserves, Americans will realize how much it means for us, how opportune it is. We can now send vessels to the Atlantic or Pacific as we wish, and be ready for any emergency in either ocean. Let us note that it is completed just in time, when, because of the European war, America has been given an opportunity to extend its merchant marine and its commerce. We will enter the trade of the Pacific under the most encouraging circumstances and conditions. All Americans will hail this great work of American genius, enterprise, courage and skill, the greatest engineering feat ever accomplished or even attempted by any land. In that rejoicing New Orleans, as the nearest American port to the canal, heartily and enthusiastically joins.Reading Comprehension Questions:1.

                                            In the 15th century, the Europeans began to exploit the human resources of Africa. The Portuguese French, and English started to bring thousands of slaves back to mainland Europe and America, they were bought and sold like objects so they could work in plantations and serve their masters. This came to be known as the Atlantic Slave Trade. However, this commercial enterprise did not go an antislavery letter unchallenged as calls for abolition soon emerged. The following selection addressed to the Queen of England - is lifted from the autobiography of a prominent 18th century abolitionist. Though this man's birth name was Olaudah Equiano, the letter bears the signature "Gustavus Vassa"- the name given to him by the Royal Navy Officer who "bought" him from the slave trade.Letter to Queen Charlotte To Her Most Excellent Majesty: Your Majesty's well-known benevolence and humanity emboldens me to approach your royal presence, trusting that the obscurity of my situation will not prevent your majesty from attending to the sufferings for which I plead. Yet I do not solicit your royal pity for my own distress; my sufferings although numerous are, in a measure, forgotten. I supplicate your Majesty's compassion for the millions of my African countrymen, who groan under the lash of tyranny in the West Indies. The oppression and cruelty exercised to the unhappy negroes there, have at length reached the British legislature, and they are now deliberating on its redress; even several persons of property in slaves in the West Indies have petitioned parliament against its continuance, sensible that it is as impolitic as it is unjust and what is inhuman must ever be unwise. Your Majesty's reign has been hitherto distinguished by private acts of benevolence and bounty; surely the more extended the misery is, the greater claim it has to your Majesty's compassion, and the greater must be your Majesty's pleasure in administering to its relief. I presume, therefore, gracious Queen, to implore your interposition with your royal consort, in favour of the wretched Africans; that, by your Majesty's benevolent influence, a period may now be put to their misery; and that they may be raised from the condition of brutes to which they are at present degraded to the rights and situation of freemen, and admitted to partake of the blessings of your Majesty's happy government; so shall your Majesty enjoy the heartfelt pleasure of procuring happiness to millions, and be rewarded in the grateful prayers of themselves and of their posterity. And may the all-bountiful Creator shower on your Majesty and the Royal Family every blessing that this world can afford, and every fullness of joy which divine revelation has promised us in the next. I am your Majesty's most dutiful and devoted servant to command, No. 53, Baldwin's Gardens. Gustavus Vassa, The Oppressed Ethiopean 15200 h himComprehension Check Answer the following questions: 1. What is Equiano's main petition in his letter? What is he asking the Queen to grant? 2. What does Equiano's letter imply about the condition of the "wretched Africans"? What does he mean by the phrase? 3. According to Equiano, what reward could the Queen receive if she grants his petition? 4. Do you think this letter was effective in terms of conveying Equiano's true intentions? Why why not?​</a>

                                            EDITORIAL Face-to-face classes(The Philippine Star) - December 1, 2020 - 12:00am Based on reports from the field, education officials themselves have reported the difficulties being encountered by students in blended learning. Apart from intermittent WiFi connection or lack of access to gadgets and the internet, there are school children who lack a private space at home that is conducive to learning.Many students also need learning assistance from their parents. And there are parents who are unprepared to take on the role of tutors, either because they need to earn a living while their children are in school, or else because they lack the knowledge and skills required for the task.Faced with such challenges, education officials are now discussing the possibility of resuming limited face-to-face classes as soon as circumstances allow. If the plan pushes through, the initial areas for the resumption will be those without COVID transmission over a certain period.The Office of the Vice President has become embroiled in another controversy as Department of Education officials denied giving the green light for the "Community Learning Hubs" set up by the OVP in several areas. The OVP has clarified that the hubs are not rooms where face-to-face classes are held, but areas similar to internet shops, where school children without gadgets or WiFi at home can access the internet for their online classes. Difficult learners can also have access to tutors at the hubs. The seats are spaced following distancing protocols and are separated by transparent acrylic dividers.Similar setups have been implemented in several countries where on-site classroom learning has resumed following a significant downward trend in coronavirus transmission. In recent weeks, however, some of the countries had to suspend the classes anew following a fresh wave of COVID cases. These developments are being monitored by DepEd officials amid discussions on the gradual resumption of face-to face classes.President Duterte has said there will be no face-to-face classes until a COVID vaccine becomes available. The position may have to be modified, however, if only to reduce the number of students being left behind as a result of pandemic restrictions. With the end of late enrollment on Nov. 21, the DepEd reported nearly 25 million total enrollees in both public and private elementary and high schools. This means about two million students are out of school for this academic year. With face-to-face classes still banned, the government must find innovative ways of promoting safe and inclusive learning.16. What is the editorial text all about?A. Distance LearningB.

                            6. WORKSHEET #.1 IN ENGLISH 9Prejudice refers to a preconceived opinion or feeling toward a person based solely on their affiliation with a group. This feelingmay be translated into action by discriminating against the person or members of the target group. An individual may beprejudiced against others based on factors such as race, age, gender, sexual crientation, class status, religion, nationality, andamongst other thingsExaniples:a) "I don't want Blacks living in my neighborhood!"b) "I don't want Jews owning businesses in my town!"c) "I don't want a Muslim community center in lower Manhattan!"These examples clearly show that there are prejudices going on. The statements prejudge against black people, Jews, andMuslims basically because of their race, nationality and religion Even though they have not done anything wrong yet, but becauseof their backgrounds, people tend to prejudge them and eventually discriminate them. These are very common in our society evenup to the present time.Another term that causes confusion and is often used interchangeably with "prejudice" is "bias". But these two termsdiffer from each other. Let's examine how it differs from the formerBias is a tendency to lean in a certain direction, either in favor of or against a particular thing. To be truly biased meansto lack a neutral viewpoint on a particular topic. Somewhere along the line, bias took on a negative connotation. If you're biasedtoward something, then you lean favorably toward it; you tend to think positively of it. Meanwhile, if you're biased againstsomething, then you lean negatively against it; you tend to think poorly of it.Examples:a) In other Christian sects, the preacher position is only given to niales and not to females.b) Sectarian schools only accept students who share the same religious beliefs.c) Sonie churches don't accept women who wear pants instead of dresses or skirts during their services.In the given examples, a certain group or people is given favor than the other. In number one, males are given morerower or authority than females. Number two, students who are interested to study in a school but don't share the same religioncan't be admitted. And lastly, women who want to attend church services aren't allowed to go if they don't wear the prescribedclothes for the said servicesANSWER THE FOLLOWING:Study and evaluate whether the given scenarios contain biases and prejudices. Write bias, prejudice, or none.1. Some Muslims are assumed to be terrorists and eventually being discriminated.2. Jews during the period of 'Hitler were sentenced to death because Hitler himself despised Jewish people.3. A teacher who gives good rating to her student who shares the same religious belief with her4. A married couple living in a new country where they are free to attend to any of their church services5. Tom Cruise's affiliation with Scientology prompts all kinds of negative press6. Not hiring someone because of their age or gender.7. Assuming someone is gay because of the way he acts.8.

                            7. OPENING OF THE PANAMA CANAL The Panama Canal was officially opened yesterday when a large vessel of the War Department, the Ancon, went through from ocean to ocean. The event was celebrated locally–it was a public holiday along the isthmus–and from New Orleans and other cities interested in the canal and expecting to use it and profit by it, congratulatory telegrams poured in. The big affair will not come for several months. It has been expected and arranged for that every maritime nation should send some of its crack men-of-war to take part in a great naval parade through the canal next year, and naval displays were proposed for New York, New Orleans and San Francisco. Invitations had been extended to all countries, and even Switzerland had been asked to have some vessel as its representative at Panama. What the celebration will be in the face of present European conditions it is impossible to say. It may be confined to our own fleet and that of our immediate neighbors. Even if the war is ended the chances are against such an international display as had been planned and as that attending the opening of the Suez Canal. Europe will be tired out, with no fever of festival and no desire for naval demonstrations. In the meanwhile, although the canal is now open, and vessels can operate through it, the government will continue to improve, to deepen it for larger vessels, and to make it wider, especially at the Culebra cut, which has been the most difficult portion of the canal from the very beginning. Because of the European trouble and the generally demoralized condition of the world’s merchant marine, the canal will not be used for commerce at the start to the extent that we had hoped for, and it will not be fair to take the first few months’ record as giving any idea what it will do. It is probable that a very large amount of the steamship tonnage going through the canal will be American coastwise vessels running between our Pacific and the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. It is gratifying to know that these vessels will include one or more lines from New Orleans, so that this city will get the share of the canal business it has expected. While there may be some slight disappointment over the fact that the canal was completed during a period of war, when it will not receive the attention it deserves, Americans will realize how much it means for us, how opportune it is. We can now send vessels to the Atlantic or Pacific as we wish, and be ready for any emergency in either ocean. Let us note that it is completed just in time, when, because of the European war, America has been given an opportunity to extend its merchant marine and its commerce. We will enter the trade of the Pacific under the most encouraging circumstances and conditions. All Americans will hail this great work of American genius, enterprise, courage and skill, the greatest engineering feat ever accomplished or even attempted by any land. In that rejoicing New Orleans, as the nearest American port to the canal, heartily and enthusiastically joins.Reading Comprehension Questions:1. The text says "naval displays were proposed for New York, New Orleans and San Francisco." Why do you think these cities were mentioned especially?2. The text refers to the plan for all countries to participate, "even Switzerland." Why do you think it singled out Switzerland?3. The article is from a New Orleans newspaper. Cite one quotation from the text that shows the article has a distinct point of view for New Orleans readers.4.

                            8. In the 15th century, the Europeans began to exploit the human resources of Africa. The Portuguese French, and English started to bring thousands of slaves back to mainland Europe and America, they were bought and sold like objects so they could work in plantations and serve their masters. This came to be known as the Atlantic Slave Trade. However, this commercial enterprise did not go an antislavery letter unchallenged as calls for abolition soon emerged. The following selection addressed to the Queen of England - is lifted from the autobiography of a prominent 18th century abolitionist. Though this man's birth name was Olaudah Equiano, the letter bears the signature "Gustavus Vassa"- the name given to him by the Royal Navy Officer who "bought" him from the slave trade.Letter to Queen Charlotte To Her Most Excellent Majesty: Your Majesty's well-known benevolence and humanity emboldens me to approach your royal presence, trusting that the obscurity of my situation will not prevent your majesty from attending to the sufferings for which I plead. Yet I do not solicit your royal pity for my own distress; my sufferings although numerous are, in a measure, forgotten. I supplicate your Majesty's compassion for the millions of my African countrymen, who groan under the lash of tyranny in the West Indies. The oppression and cruelty exercised to the unhappy negroes there, have at length reached the British legislature, and they are now deliberating on its redress; even several persons of property in slaves in the West Indies have petitioned parliament against its continuance, sensible that it is as impolitic as it is unjust and what is inhuman must ever be unwise. Your Majesty's reign has been hitherto distinguished by private acts of benevolence and bounty; surely the more extended the misery is, the greater claim it has to your Majesty's compassion, and the greater must be your Majesty's pleasure in administering to its relief. I presume, therefore, gracious Queen, to implore your interposition with your royal consort, in favour of the wretched Africans; that, by your Majesty's benevolent influence, a period may now be put to their misery; and that they may be raised from the condition of brutes to which they are at present degraded to the rights and situation of freemen, and admitted to partake of the blessings of your Majesty's happy government; so shall your Majesty enjoy the heartfelt pleasure of procuring happiness to millions, and be rewarded in the grateful prayers of themselves and of their posterity. And may the all-bountiful Creator shower on your Majesty and the Royal Family every blessing that this world can afford, and every fullness of joy which divine revelation has promised us in the next. I am your Majesty's most dutiful and devoted servant to command, No. 53, Baldwin's Gardens. Gustavus Vassa, The Oppressed Ethiopean 15200 h himComprehension Check Answer the following questions: 1. What is Equiano's main petition in his letter? What is he asking the Queen to grant? 2. What does Equiano's letter imply about the condition of the "wretched Africans"? What does he mean by the phrase? 3. According to Equiano, what reward could the Queen receive if she grants his petition? 4. Do you think this letter was effective in terms of conveying Equiano's true intentions? Why why not?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Olaudah <strong>Equiano</strong>, a <strong>prominent abolitionist </strong>in the <strong>18th century</strong> mainly petitioned to help his fellow Africans from the slavery that they were experiencing under the <strong>Atlantic Slave Trade</strong>. He was asking the Queen of England to help his countrymen and give them equal rights as that what the freemen have. He wanted to abolish the system of <strong>slavery </strong>in that century.</p><p></p><p>Equiano implies that the <strong>wretched Africans</strong> were poorly treated, even abused, and treated unfairly. They experience tyranny under the masters they serve. They are oppressed for being negroes.</p><p></p><p>The people which the queen reigned will give her more of their approval because of her benevolence and compassion regarding the plight of the Africans under their slavery. Equiano said that if the queen helped it will bring happiness and blessings to her government, the people in it, and the Africans and their descendants.</p><p></p><p>I think the letter is effective because Equiano repeatedly shows his respect, empathy, and wit while writing the letter. He also used the word benevolence a lot of times which might get the attention and sympathy of the queen.

EDITORIAL Face-to-face classes(The Philippine Star) - December 1, 2020 - 12:00am Based on reports from the field, education officials themselves have reported the difficulties being encountered by students in blended learning. Apart from intermittent WiFi connection or lack of access to gadgets and the internet, there are school children who lack a private space at home that is conducive to learning.Many students also need learning assistance from their parents. And there are parents who are unprepared to take on the role of tutors, either because they need to earn a living while their children are in school, or else because they lack the knowledge and skills required for the task.Faced with such challenges, education officials are now discussing the possibility of resuming limited face-to-face classes as soon as circumstances allow. If the plan pushes through, the initial areas for the resumption will be those without COVID transmission over a certain period.The Office of the Vice President has become embroiled in another controversy as Department of Education officials denied giving the green light for the "Community Learning Hubs" set up by the OVP in several areas. The OVP has clarified that the hubs are not rooms where face-to-face classes are held, but areas similar to internet shops, where school children without gadgets or WiFi at home can access the internet for their online classes. Difficult learners can also have access to tutors at the hubs. The seats are spaced following distancing protocols and are separated by transparent acrylic dividers.Similar setups have been implemented in several countries where on-site classroom learning has resumed following a significant downward trend in coronavirus transmission. In recent weeks, however, some of the countries had to suspend the classes anew following a fresh wave of COVID cases. These developments are being monitored by DepEd officials amid discussions on the gradual resumption of face-to face classes.President Duterte has said there will be no face-to-face classes until a COVID vaccine becomes available. The position may have to be modified, however, if only to reduce the number of students being left behind as a result of pandemic restrictions. With the end of late enrollment on Nov. 21, the DepEd reported nearly 25 million total enrollees in both public and private elementary and high schools. This means about two million students are out of school for this academic year. With face-to-face classes still banned, the government must find innovative ways of promoting safe and inclusive learning.16. What is the editorial text all about?A. Distance LearningB.

In some cities, such as San Francisco, earthquakes are so common that millions of dollars in damage are caused by them each year. To help address this issue, some builders create houses, dwellings, and buildings that will not collapse in the event of an earthquake. This process is called seismic design or “earthquake-proofing” and helps to reduce the damage caused by earthquakes. 15. The twist is a dance inspired by rock and roll music. 16. To do the twist, first stand with your feet approximately shoulder width apart. The torso may be squared to the knees and hips, or turned at an angle so one foot is farther forward than the other. Then, hold your arms out from your body, bent at your elbow. Next, rotate your hips, torso, and legs as a single unit with your arms staying more or less stationary. Every so often lift one leg off of the floor for styling. Now you’re doing the twist! 17. Animals who have their two eyes located in front of their face include lions, wolves, and owls and they hunt.
