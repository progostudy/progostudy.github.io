                        <p>Answer:</p><p>Agree. Opportunity doesn't knock often, so it's beneficial for us to grab it everytime it does. Doesn't matter if we succeed or lose, we will always learn something by taking chances, that will help us improve as an individual. Whether it's a contest or something else, chances challenge our self-confidence. If you win, it will increase, if you don't, you'll most likely lose it but at some point, you'll grow and manage to be more confident than you already were. As they say, fall seven times and stand up eight (or something like that haha). By taking chances, you'll be stronger than ever.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            30. A good friend of yours was one of the victims of the recent super typhoon Odette. His family lost everything, including a member of the family. He almost gave up. He thought God had already abandoned their family. As a friend, what will you do? How will you uplift his spirit not to lose hope? What admirable Filipino characteristics can strengthen you to inspire your friend?​</h2><br />
                        <p>Losing a loved one is indeed a very painful process to go through but we need to understand that every challenge that God puts us under to is for the betterment in our spiritual aspect. We may think that sometimes we are alone in the journey but little did we know that God is always in our side. In the case of your situation, trying to fix someone who is still in mourning is no way to ease the pain. Instead, offer emotional support like talking about funny experiences in the past and in that way, you may be able to atleast lessen the tension. Try to distract them with recreational activities that could make them less mournful. Be gentle always and think of all the things that you'll be saying. In short, show hospitality and care to your friend. </p><br />
