                                            What is my past? (3 years in my elementary days)My classmates used to bully me because of how I look and because of my cavities.My hair is short, it's black but it got brown because of the sun.My skin is dark and my uniform is kinda dirty and I can't even straighten my uniform because we can't afford anything.Our house is made of old wood and when it rain, we have to move into the madrasah where student learn how to read and write Arabic.I don't usually go straight into the classroom because I'll just get bullied again, what I do is, there is this tree where you have to climb and sit down. It's cold there since it's windy and you can also see a lot of cars pases by.Until one day, they have to take that tree down.It really did made me sad because I also named that tree miyaka since it's also my home, it where I feel the peace. I cried my eyes out when I saw them cut the tree.After that I have to stay in the classroom, And I cried there because of how everyone treats me because of my imperfections.(1st Year Highschool)I have new friends in my high school, I was shy and can't say anything. I changed myself into someone that isn't me. I tried everything to fit into our school so that I won't be bullied.But then again my bullies are my classmates again in highschool and they tell everyone how they bully me and some of the students bully me too, I can't fight back because I am scared that they might have to call my parents when I get into the guidance office so I just letter them.(4 years has passed)I'm in my senior high, and this time I really did have friends, I'm not classmates with my bullies so I was relieved. My senior high went well.And 2 years has passed and I'm in my college now, two members of my bullies are my classmates and they are shocked to see how I changed into a person that fights back.So they made friends with me but never said sorry but in my heart, I already forgave them.Apologized or not.​</a>

                                            Read and Learn The Milkmaid Mutya, the Milkmaid, was going to the market carrying a huge pail of pure milk on her head. She hummed a happy tune while walking. As she went along, she began thinking of what she would do with the money she would get for the milk. "I'll buy some chicken from Mang Tomas," she said, "and they will lay eggs each morning, then I will sell the eggs to the mayor's wife. With the money that I will get from the sale of the eggs, I'm sure I can buy myself a cute dress and a hat; and when I go to the market I would be a muse. Won't all the young men come up and speak to me! Ana will be that jealous, but I don't care. I shall just look at her and toss my head like this." As she spoke, she tossed her head back, the pail fell down, and all the milk was spilled. She had to go home and tell her mother what happened. Talk about it 1. What did Mutya plan to buy with her money? 2 When did she stop thinking about her plans? 3. How did she feel about the spilt milk? 4 How do you think her mother feel? 5. What advice do you think did her mother give her? 6. If you were Mutya, what would you do? 7. How can Mutya realize her plans? &amp; How can you realize your own plans?​</a>

                                            What is the mood in the song called "All Too Well by Taylor Swift" ?
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well</a>

                                            how messed up is this?!
 my mom turned off my phone number for 6 months unless I can get my grades up. (i have mostly d's and a couple of f's and one c...) and now my dad can't call me or use the tracker. no number means no tracker. and I have a hard time sleeping as it is. I wake up late a lot of the time but before I would have people call me in the mornings to wake me up. I have 2 alarms that go off. and yesterday I decided to use my third one. I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</a>

Spare me and I will tell you your future!"The wolf agreed, and the fortunteller held the wolfs ear as she concentrated.After a few minutes of deep thought, the fortuneteller told the wolf, "You will become a shepard"The wolf instantly sat down and started crying, much to the surprise of the fortuneteller."Why are you crying asked the fortuneteller.*I'm afraid you might be lying, replied the wolf.​</a>

                                            thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.

Tell Me a Story About Your Shoes   One Thursday morning at a soup kitchen /community center for homeless wo downtown Boston I was given this gift of a story in response to the opening prompt, Tell me abo your shoes."I pass this story along now in honor of the woman who shared t You see these beautiful white sneakers? I didn't always have them. My last pair of shoes was pretty sad. After many winters of walking the show and slush, I was holding them together with cardboard and masking tape. So I decided to go to the mall to get a new pair. There's a shoes story there that often has sneakers I can afford. Walking through the mall I knew everyone was looking at me being there. I wanted to get my new shoes quick and leave. Walking down the aisle, I saw a really nice pair of white sneakers. There was only this one pair in my size left I put them on and couldn't believe how good they felt: I walk all around the store in them, thinking how rice it would be if they were mine knew I didn't have money to get them that day but I also knew that if I waited they'd be gone, I brought them up to the front of the store and asked the guy behind the counter of he would hold them for me. He said it was against store policy. I promised hem I would come back as soon as I could to buy them but he just kept shaking his head and saying no, he couldn't. I put my masking tape sneakers back on and left the mall as fast as I could For the next two weeks, I scraped by until had enough money to go back for my shoes Funny how I kept calling them mine, as if somehow I could protect them from going home with anyone else. The day I had enough money, I ran all the way to the mall, and ignored all those people staring at my masking tape shoes. I went to the shelf where I left them, with my eyes half shut afraid to look Sure enough they were gone. I looked at every pair of shoes in the aide that had my site, but there were no shoes left like them. They were gone. I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day, I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me. I started to walk faster to get away, but he an after me still yelling "I have your shoes. me a few times of hearing it to get what be meant I HAVE YOUR SHOES "OK", I said. "Tve got the money now to pay for them." "No. No, he said "They've been pad for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours" I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day. I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me, I started to walk faster to get away, but he ran after me, still yelling. "I have your shoes." It took me a few times of hearing it to get what he meant. 1 HAVE YOUR SHOES. "OK", I said. "I've got the money now to pay for them." "No. No", he said "They've been paid for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours" 1 can't tell you what when on in my head in that moment. I only remember leaving my old shoes in the trash bin and walking out into the mall wearing my new white sneakers with money still in my pocket. I took my time leaving that day. As I walked past each stranger, I looked them in the eye and smiled. I felt so good. It wasn't that I thought that they were looking at me differently because of my new sneakers. It was more that i was seeing them differently. I used to think no one was on my side. But that day I knew that any person I walked by could be the one who gave my new shoes. Whoever they were, I wanted them to know I was saying, "Thank you". need the answer now :) thank you...​</a>

With the money that I will get from the sale of the eggs, I'm sure I can buy myself a cute dress and a hat; and when I go to the market I would be a muse. Won't all the young men come up and speak to me! Ana will be that jealous, but I don't care. I shall just look at her and toss my head like this."

On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear

Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere

No one to tell us, "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

With new horizons to pursue (every moment, red-letter)
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
And then we're home (there's time to spare)
Let me share this whole new world with you
A whole new world (a whole new world)
That's where we'll be (that's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase (a wondrous place)

                                            You were not able to prepare for your graded report in Oral Communication. Mr. Reyes, then calls you to go to the front and start your presentation. How are you going to explain your situation yo your teacher?    In this situation, the first thing I would do is to admit that I was not able to prepare for the presentation and explain why. After I finish explaining to Mr. Reyes the reason why I was unprepared, I would then gladly accept the mistake I made and face all the consequences that will come with it. Once I've come to terms with my mistake, I would then apologize to Mr. Reyes for the mishap I have caused. Then, I would ask him if I can redo, the presentation, and do anything to get the grade, if I were given the chance.Your cousin, Karl, calls you over the phone and tells you that he cannot help you in your errand because he needs to do something for his school project. What will you tell him to convince him to spare you a bit of his time and that you need him to buy the surprise birthday gift for your father?    I would politely ask Karl again if he can help me with my errand. I would tell him that I would help him with his school project after we finish the errand. I would also tell him that sparing a bit of his time is already a big help and that I'd appreciate it if he helps me. Once he agrees, I would also promise him that he can also call me when he needs help on another errand.You are about to start with your report which you have failed to prepare for when your mother calls you on your mobile phone. How are you going to respond to your mother? What will you tell her?    I would answer the call first to check with my mother if it was an urgent call. If she tells me that it wasn't urgent, then I would politely ask my mother to wait for me to call her back, as I am about to do a presentation. However, if the call was urgent, I would first ask my teacher if I can spare a few minutes for my mother. If the teacher does not approve, then I will just try to listen to her on speaker phone as I do my presentation.You are in the middle of your discussion about the Tree-Planting Initiative of your school but you noticed that the District Supervisor is not really paying attention to what you are saying. How will you address the Supervisor respectfully?    If I saw the supervisor was not listening to me, I would politely ask him for his opinion. This is a strategy to get his attention without disrespecting their authority.You are already on your way home when your best friend, Diego, approaches you and asks for your help with his graded report tomorrow. You know that you need to go home early because of the surprise birthday party for your father but you also see the concerned look on your best friend. What will you do and what are you going to tell Diego?    First, I would check up on the time to see if I have extra time before the party starts. If I have enough time, I would help Diego with his report. However, if there wasn't enough time before the party, I would ask Diego if I can just help him after the party. If he tells me that he's not available after the party, then I would help him find someone to help him with the project instead. I would've asked him to come over at the party, so that we can do it there, but I would not risk it since it would be disrespectful to my family.​</a>

                            5. What is my past? (3 years in my elementary days)My classmates used to bully me because of how I look and because of my cavities.My hair is short, it's black but it got brown because of the sun.My skin is dark and my uniform is kinda dirty and I can't even straighten my uniform because we can't afford anything.Our house is made of old wood and when it rain, we have to move into the madrasah where student learn how to read and write Arabic.I don't usually go straight into the classroom because I'll just get bullied again, what I do is, there is this tree where you have to climb and sit down. It's cold there since it's windy and you can also see a lot of cars pases by.Until one day, they have to take that tree down.It really did made me sad because I also named that tree miyaka since it's also my home, it where I feel the peace. I cried my eyes out when I saw them cut the tree.After that I have to stay in the classroom, And I cried there because of how everyone treats me because of my imperfections.(1st Year Highschool)I have new friends in my high school, I was shy and can't say anything. I changed myself into someone that isn't me. I tried everything to fit into our school so that I won't be bullied.But then again my bullies are my classmates again in highschool and they tell everyone how they bully me and some of the students bully me too, I can't fight back because I am scared that they might have to call my parents when I get into the guidance office so I just letter them.(4 years has passed)I'm in my senior high, and this time I really did have friends, I'm not classmates with my bullies so I was relieved. My senior high went well.And 2 years has passed and I'm in my college now, two members of my bullies are my classmates and they are shocked to see how I changed into a person that fights back.So they made friends with me but never said sorry but in my heart, I already forgave them.Apologized or not.​</h2><br />

"I'll buy some chicken from Mang Tomas," she said, "and they will lay eggs each morning, then I will sell the eggs to the mayor's wife. With the money that I will get from the sale of the eggs, I'm sure I can buy myself a cute dress and a hat; and when I go to the market I would be a muse. Won't all the young men come up and speak to me! Ana will be that jealous, but I don't care. I shall just look at her and toss my head like this." As she spoke, she tossed her head back, the pail fell down, and all the milk was spilled. She had to go home and tell her mother what happened. Talk about it 1.

                            8. What is the mood in the song called "All Too Well by Taylor Swift" ?
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well</h2><br />

                            9. how messed up is this?!
 my mom turned off my phone number for 6 months unless I can get my grades up. (i have mostly d's and a couple of f's and one c...) and now my dad can't call me or use the tracker. no number means no tracker. and I have a hard time sleeping as it is. I wake up late a lot of the time but before I would have people call me in the mornings to wake me up. I have 2 alarms that go off. and yesterday I decided to use my third one. I still was late for school. I got to school about 15 minutes after the fifth period bell. rest of the school day was normal. looking for people, doing my work, try not to be alone, you know... after school was me trying to get the boy I like to notice me since he kept ignoring me. it was really hard to manage it. in the end, we sat at a table and we were talking for about two and a half hours. since my dad can't use the tracker anymore he left the house to look for me. when I saw him I had just gotten off the bus, but I didn't want to be picked up so I kept walking... when I got home I started to clean my room and a half was cleaning my desk he came home. he yelled at me for about 30 min about everything. I am blaming my mom for my dad having to come to find me. reason? she is the one that disabled my number. when we originally discussed my number it was just going to be restricted. but no. after he finished, I went to my room and cried for about 30 min. after I was ready I went to eat. when I was almost done he came and yelled at me AGAIN for the same things. the only thing that kept me calm was the fact that I was eating. (and reading...) so as you can tell, my life is hell for me. and I'm not even going to get into my love life... so please tell me what you think.</h2><br />

(Dear Mama)Sweet lady, place no one above you (You are appreciated)Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fairNo love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't thereHe passed away and I didn't cry, 'cause my angerWouldn't let me feel for a strangerThey say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all alongI was lookin' for a father, he was goneI hung around with the thugsAnd even though they sold drugsThey showed a young brother loveI moved out and started really hangin'I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocksIt feels good puttin' money in your mailboxI love payin' rent when the rent's dueI hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you'Cause when I was low you was there for meAnd never left me alone, because you cared for meAnd I could see you comin' home after work lateYou're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plateYou just workin' with the scraps you was givenAnd Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'But now the road got rough, you're aloneYou're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your ownAnd there's no way I can pay you backBut my plan is to show you that I understandYou are appreciatedLady, don't you know we love you? (And dear Mama)Sweet lady, place no one above you (You are appreciated)Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?Pour out some liquor and I reminisce'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mamaAnd when it seems that I'm hopelessYou say the words that can get me back in focusWhen I was sick as a little kidTo keep me happy there's no limit to the things you didAnd all my childhood memoriesAre full of all the sweet things you did for meAnd even though I act crazyI gotta thank the Lord that you made meThere are no words that can express how I feelYou never kept a secret, always stayed realAnd I appreciate how you raised meAnd all the extra love that you gave meI wish I could take the pain awayIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter dayEverything will be alright if you hold onIt's a struggle every day, gotta roll onAnd there's no way I can pay you backBut my plan is to show you that I understandYou are appreciatedLady, don't you know we love you?

                            13. thank you for helping meFriends can  be  classified  according  to  their honesty ,  loyalty , the  type  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  or  the  type  that  finds  time  for  you  when  they  need  something.  An  honest  friend  tells  you  the  truth  even  if  it’s  not  always  what  you  want  to  hear.  In  the  long  run ,  that  honest  friend  may  have  saved  you  from  embarrassment  or  possibly  rejection.  They give you  constructive  criticisms  overall.  The  loyal  friend  is  the  type  of  friend  that  will  be  there  for  you  through  thick  and  thin.  They  don’t  care  how  good  or  bad  you  may  look  one  day;  they  are  sensitive  to  your  feelings ,  they  respect  you  and  the  other  people  in  your  life,  and  most  of  all  they  will  never  let  you  down  when  times  are  hard.  They may  be  what  you  call  a  best  friend.  The  third  group,  the  person  that  fits  you  into  their  schedule ,  is  the  type  of  person  that  is  always  on  the  go. They barely have  time  for  themselves  let  alone  another  person.  More  than  likely  they  will  not  be  there  for  you  when  you  need  them  most,  because  they  are  so  wrapped  up  in  their  busy  ,  hectic  life.  Then  you  have  the  self-absorbent  type of  friend  that  finds  time  for  you  only  when  they  need  something. This  type  of  person isn’t  what  you  would  call  a  friend.  This  person  may  always  be  extremely  nice  to  you  because  they  know  that from being nice they will more than likely get what they want. They  will call  you  every  once  in  a while  when  it is almost  time  for  them  to  use  that  person  again.  It  may  be  for  a  ride  to  work,  home  or  they  just  want  somebody  to  hangout  with  because  they  have  no  other  friends.  If  the  person  that  is  being  used  is  smart  they  will eventually  realize  that  they  are  getting  used  and  will  stop  being  there  for  that  person.

Tell Me a Story About Your Shoes   One Thursday morning at a soup kitchen /community center for homeless wo downtown Boston I was given this gift of a story in response to the opening prompt, Tell me abo your shoes."I pass this story along now in honor of the woman who shared t You see these beautiful white sneakers? I didn't always have them. My last pair of shoes was pretty sad. After many winters of walking the show and slush, I was holding them together with cardboard and masking tape. So I decided to go to the mall to get a new pair. There's a shoes story there that often has sneakers I can afford. Walking through the mall I knew everyone was looking at me being there. I wanted to get my new shoes quick and leave. Walking down the aisle, I saw a really nice pair of white sneakers. There was only this one pair in my size left I put them on and couldn't believe how good they felt: I walk all around the store in them, thinking how rice it would be if they were mine knew I didn't have money to get them that day but I also knew that if I waited they'd be gone, I brought them up to the front of the store and asked the guy behind the counter of he would hold them for me. He said it was against store policy. I promised hem I would come back as soon as I could to buy them but he just kept shaking his head and saying no, he couldn't. I put my masking tape sneakers back on and left the mall as fast as I could For the next two weeks, I scraped by until had enough money to go back for my shoes Funny how I kept calling them mine, as if somehow I could protect them from going home with anyone else. The day I had enough money, I ran all the way to the mall, and ignored all those people staring at my masking tape shoes. I went to the shelf where I left them, with my eyes half shut afraid to look Sure enough they were gone. I looked at every pair of shoes in the aide that had my site, but there were no shoes left like them. They were gone. I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day, I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me. I started to walk faster to get away, but he an after me still yelling "I have your shoes. me a few times of hearing it to get what be meant I HAVE YOUR SHOES "OK", I said. "Tve got the money now to pay for them." "No. No, he said "They've been pad for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours" I started for the door, I wasn't ready to try on anything else that day. I just felt too worn down to look anymore. That when the manager yelled at me, I started to walk faster to get away, but he ran after me, still yelling. "I have your shoes." It took me a few times of hearing it to get what he meant. 1 HAVE YOUR SHOES. "OK", I said. "I've got the money now to pay for them." "No. No", he said "They've been paid for. That's why I've got them. They're now yours" 1 can't tell you what when on in my head in that moment. I only remember leaving my old shoes in the trash bin and walking out into the mall wearing my new white sneakers with money still in my pocket. I took my time leaving that day. As I walked past each stranger, I looked them in the eye and smiled. I felt so good. It wasn't that I thought that they were looking at me differently because of my new sneakers. It was more that i was seeing them differently. I used to think no one was on my side. But that day I knew that any person I walked by could be the one who gave my new shoes. Whoever they were, I wanted them to know I was saying, "Thank you". need the answer now :) thank you...​</h2><br />

As she went along, she began thinking of what she would do with the money she would get for the milk. "I'll buy some chicken from Mang Tomas," said she, "and they will lay eggs each morning, then I will sell the eggs to the mayor's wife. With the money that I will get from the sale of the eggs, I'm sure I can buy myself a cute dress and a hat; and when I go to the market I would be a muse. Won't all the young men come up and speak to me! Ana will be that jealous, but I don't care. I shall just look at her and toss my head like this."

You last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
(Now I'm in a whole new world with you)
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
A whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you
A whole new world (a whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us, "No"
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

With new horizons to pursue (every moment, red-letter)

                            30. You were not able to prepare for your graded report in Oral Communication. Mr. Reyes, then calls you to go to the front and start your presentation. How are you going to explain your situation yo your teacher?    In this situation, the first thing I would do is to admit that I was not able to prepare for the presentation and explain why. After I finish explaining to Mr. Reyes the reason why I was unprepared, I would then gladly accept the mistake I made and face all the consequences that will come with it. Once I've come to terms with my mistake, I would then apologize to Mr. Reyes for the mishap I have caused. Then, I would ask him if I can redo, the presentation, and do anything to get the grade, if I were given the chance.Your cousin, Karl, calls you over the phone and tells you that he cannot help you in your errand because he needs to do something for his school project. What will you tell him to convince him to spare you a bit of his time and that you need him to buy the surprise birthday gift for your father?    I would politely ask Karl again if he can help me with my errand. I would tell him that I would help him with his school project after we finish the errand. I would also tell him that sparing a bit of his time is already a big help and that I'd appreciate it if he helps me. Once he agrees, I would also promise him that he can also call me when he needs help on another errand.You are about to start with your report which you have failed to prepare for when your mother calls you on your mobile phone. How are you going to respond to your mother? What will you tell her?    I would answer the call first to check with my mother if it was an urgent call. If she tells me that it wasn't urgent, then I would politely ask my mother to wait for me to call her back, as I am about to do a presentation. However, if the call was urgent, I would first ask my teacher if I can spare a few minutes for my mother. If the teacher does not approve, then I will just try to listen to her on speaker phone as I do my presentation.You are in the middle of your discussion about the Tree-Planting Initiative of your school but you noticed that the District Supervisor is not really paying attention to what you are saying. How will you address the Supervisor respectfully?    If I saw the supervisor was not listening to me, I would politely ask him for his opinion. This is a strategy to get his attention without disrespecting their authority.You are already on your way home when your best friend, Diego, approaches you and asks for your help with his graded report tomorrow. You know that you need to go home early because of the surprise birthday party for your father but you also see the concerned look on your best friend. What will you do and what are you going to tell Diego?    First, I would check up on the time to see if I have extra time before the party starts. If I have enough time, I would help Diego with his report. However, if there wasn't enough time before the party, I would ask Diego if I can just help him after the party. If he tells me that he's not available after the party, then I would help him find someone to help him with the project instead. I would've asked him to come over at the party, so that we can do it there, but I would not risk it since it would be disrespectful to my family.​</h2><br />
