                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Shahrazad Si Shahrazad ay matalino, mahusay na nagbabasa, at determinado. Ang kanyang malawak na kaalaman sa mga alamat at alamat ay nagtitiwala sa kanya na maaari niyang aliwin ang hari sa mga kuwento gabi-gabi. Malakas din ang loob niya para malaman na baka patayin pa rin siya nito. Marami sa mga kwento ni Shahrazad ang nagtuturo ng mga aral tungkol sa mga panganib ng kalupitan at ang kabutihan ng kabaitan. Sa bawat bersyon ng The Arabian Nights, matagumpay niyang nakumbinsi ang hari na itigil ang kanyang pagpatay. Haring Shahrayar Isang miyembro ng Dinastiyang Sasanid, si Haring Shahrayar ay matigas ang ulo at malupit. Matapos siyang ipagkanulo ng kanyang asawa, hinamak niya ang lahat ng kababaihan at nangakong papatayin ang bawat bagong nobya sa gabi ng kanyang kasal. Dahil ang pagtataksil ng kanyang asawa ay lubhang nakaapekto sa kanyang pananaw sa mundo, siya ay nakikiramay sa sinumang lalaki na sinaktan o pinagtaksilan ng mga babae. Ngunit mahina rin siya sa mga talento sa pagkukuwento ni Shahrazad at sabik na marinig ang bawat bagong kuwento. Sa bawat bersyon ng The Arabian Nights, pinatawad niya si Shahrazad at iniligtas ang kanyang buhay. Harun al-Rashid Si Harun al-Rashid ay palakaibigan at palakaibigan, madalas na gumagala sa Baghdad na nagbabalatkayo upang gumugol ng oras sa mga tao. Mahilig siya sa karangyaan at may napakagandang palasyo na may maraming asawa. Ang kanyang pagnanasa para sa katarungan ay ginagawa siyang kabaligtaran ni Haring Shahrayar. Bagaman siya ay may mabilis na init ng ulo, ang kanyang galit ay madalas na panandalian. Ang kanyang karakter ay batay sa makasaysayang al-Rashid (766–809), na namuno sa Baghdad mula 786 hanggang sa kanyang kamatayan noong 809. Ja'far Si Ja'far ay mas maingat at nakalaan kaysa kay al-Rashid. Binalaan niya si Harun al-Rashid na huwag tanungin ang mga kapatid na babae tungkol sa kanilang kakaibang pag-uugali sa "The Porter and the Three Ladies." Obligado siyang sundin ang mga utos ni al-Rashid kahit na hindi niya naiintindihan o sinasang-ayunan ang mga ito, at minsan ay nadidismaya siya sa katigasan ng ulo ng caliph. Barbero Ang barbero ay isang nangungunang comic figure sa mga kuwento. Wala siyang kamalayan sa sarili, madalas na pinupuri ang kanyang sariling karunungan, habang napapansin ng iba ang kanyang mga hangal na aksyon. Bagama't palagi siyang nagsasalita, tinutukoy niya ang kanyang sarili bilang "The Silent One." Gayunpaman, ang barbero ay may mabuting puso at sa huli ay nanalo sa pabor ng hari ng Tsina sa pamamagitan ng pagliligtas sa buhay ng isang kuba. Mangingisda Ang mangingisda ay bigo sa kanyang kahirapan. Nagrereklamo siya tungkol sa kanyang pagsusumikap at kawalan ng gantimpala. Kapag nakipagtawaran siya para sa kanyang buhay kasama ang demonyo, napatunayang siya ay tuso at matalino. Sa kalaunan ay nakakuha siya ng pabor ng isang hari sa pamamagitan ng paghuli ng mga enchanted fish.Nur al-Din Ali al-Misri Si Nur al-Din Ali al-Misri ay mapagmahal ngunit matigas ang ulo. Nakipagtalo siya sa kanyang kapatid na si Shams al-Din at sa una ay tumangging umatras. Naniniwala siyang mas mahalaga ang kanyang magiging anak kaysa sa magiging anak na babae ni Shams al-Din. Nang maglaon, nagsisi siya sa away. Gayunpaman, siya ay isang karampatang pinuno na nagbibigay ng matalinong payo sa kanyang anak na si Badr al-Din. Badr al-Din Hasan al-Basri Si Badr al-Din Hasan al-Basri ay tapat sa kanyang ama, labis na nagdadalamhati sa kanya pagkatapos ng kanyang kamatayan. Matapos dalhin sa Damascus na labag sa kanyang kalooban, umangkop siya sa isang bagong buhay at naging isang mahuhusay na kusinero. Ang kanyang kuwento ay isa sa pinaka-dramatiko sa The Arabian Nights, at maraming beses na nagbabago ang kanyang kapalaran. Sa kalaunan, muli niyang nakasama si Sit al-Husn at ang kanilang anak na si 'Ajib sa Egypt. Nur al-Din Ali ibn-Khaqan Si Nur al-Din Ali ibn-Khaqan ay promiscuous at mapusok. Nakitulog siya sa isang aliping babae na inilaan para kay Haring Muhammad, na inilalagay sa panganib ang buhay ng kanyang ama. Nang maglaon ay ginugol niya ang lahat ng kanyang pera sa mga piging para sa kanyang mga kaibigan, laban sa payo ng kanyang asawang si Anis al-Jalis. Ngunit naligtas siya sa pamamagitan ng pagkabukas-palad mula sa iba, kabilang ang mga gumagalang sa reputasyon ng kanyang ama. Nakipagkaibigan siya kay caliph Harun al-Rashid at pinakasalan si Anis al-Jalis. Nur al-Din Ali ibn-Bakkar Si Nur al-Din Ali ibn-Bakkar ay mabait at maalalahanin sa mga tapat na kaibigan. Ang kanyang pag-ibig sa asawa ng caliph na si Shams al-Nahar ay nagdudulot sa kanya ng panlulumo at mapanglaw. Hindi niya maitago ang kanyang pagmamahal sa kabila ng panganib ng lantarang paghahangad ng isang relasyon kay Shams al-Nahar. Kapag namatay siya sa kalungkutan, gayunpaman, ang buong lungsod ay nagdadalamhati sa kanya, na nagpapatunay sa kanyang katayuan bilang isang trahedya na bayani.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pa Brainliest po at sana nakatulong</p><p></p><br />

                            27. Can you recall the procedure on how to construct a frequency distribution table? The next activity introduces you to frequency distribution tables and shows you some of the ways these tables can be used to simplify data. Activity 2: Simplify things by using a table Directions: 1. Complete the table by tallying the selected letters in the sentence "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want". Tally Letters H O N E S T Y TOTAL Frequency​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>here's a step-by-step procedure on how to construct a frequency distribution table:</p><p></p><p>Collect the data: This involves gathering all the data that needs to be analyzed. In this case, the data is the letters in the sentence "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want".</p><p></p><p>Identify the categories: Determine the categories to group the data. In this case, the categories are the letters H, O, N, E, S, T, and Y.</p><p></p><p>Create a table: Create a table with two columns. The first column should be labeled "Categories" and the second column should be labeled "Frequency".</p><p></p><p>Tally the data: Count the number of times each category appears in the data. To do this, mark a vertical line for each instance of the category and group the lines into groups of five.</p><p></p><p>Record the frequencies: Record the frequency, or the number of times each category appears, in the second column of the table.</p><p></p><p>Using the given sentence "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want", we can construct the following frequency distribution table:</p><p></p><p>Categories	Frequency</p><p>H	               2</p><p>O	                2</p><p>E	                  3</p><p>S	                  2</p><p>T                 	2</p><p>Y.                 	1</p><p>In this table, we can see that the letter "O" appears the most frequently in the sentence with a frequency of 3, while the letter "Y" appears the least with a frequency of 1.</p><br />
