They say all's well that ends well but I'm in a new hell everytime, you double crossed my mind; you said "if we had been closer in age maybe it would have it been fine" and that made me want to die.

Now that you can't have me
You suddenly want me
Now that I'm with somebody else
You tell me you love me
I slept on your doorstep
Begging for one chance
Now that I finally moved on
You say that you missed me all along
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
You're messing with my head
Girl that's what you do best
Saying there's nothing you won't do
To get me to say yes
You're impossible to resist
But I wouldn't bet your heart on it
It's like I'm finally awake
And you're just a beautiful mistake
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
Thank you for showing me
Who you are underneath
No, thank you, I don't need
Another heartless misery
You think I'm doing this to make you jealous
And I know that you hate to hear this
But this is not about you anymore
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
Now that you can't have me
You suddenly want me</a>

                        HOW TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF IN A JOB INTERVIEW?<p></p><p>Hi, this is Margarette, how are you doing? I hope you are all doing great despite this chaos we are in. When I always ask what are my strengths and weaknesses, I always get to overwhelmed about the thoughts I want to pour out but I know that is unnecessary. So, I always ended up telling the things that <strong>people </strong>always say about me. Maybe that is one of my weaknesses, that for me <strong>people</strong>'s opinions matter which I do believe is wrong because <strong>people </strong>have always something to say about you regardless of if you did good or bad. It doesn't matter to them, as long as they can express their mind to you. And I also think, that is also one of my strengths that even if I take people's opinions seriously, I used them as my motivation to be a better person not to please <strong>people </strong>but for myself's growth and mindfulness. On the other side, I accept that there will be more <strong>people </strong>that are better and ahead of me but my only edge to them is my positivity and how I perceive things that always find good things in all the odds.</p><p></p><p>HOW TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF IN A JOB INTERVIEW?</p><p>brainly.ph/question/6906750</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />

                            21. Taken by (One direction) 
Now that you can't have me
You suddenly want me
Now that I'm with somebody else
You tell me you love me
I slept on your doorstep
Begging for one chance
Now that I finally moved on
You say that you missed me all along
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
You're messing with my head
Girl that's what you do best
Saying there's nothing you won't do
To get me to say yes
You're impossible to resist
But I wouldn't bet your heart on it
It's like I'm finally awake
And you're just a beautiful mistake
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
Thank you for showing me
Who you are underneath
No, thank you, I don't need
Another heartless misery
You think I'm doing this to make you jealous
And I know that you hate to hear this
But this is not about you anymore
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
You only love to see me breaking
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breaking
You only want me when I'm taken
Now that you can't have me
You suddenly want me</h2><br />
