 Marcus
Butch is a giant bulldog.He's lazy,and he doesn't want to do anything but sleep.If you accidentally disturb him while he is sleeping,he'll growl at you.His favorite toy is a tennis ball,but Butch's mouth is so big that you can never tell if he has the tennis ball with him or not.And he doesn't play with it,he just carries it around!
