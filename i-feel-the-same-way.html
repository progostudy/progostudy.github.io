3. Using this situation, explain how message is relayed by the neurons (the situation: You are walking alone. suddenly, a mad dog blocks your way. You feel afraid and you run as fast as you could.)
4. What would happen to a person if his or her spinal cord is injured?

I may not be able to talk to him anymore, you may find it impractical and unreasonable but I have to fly home. If I don’t I will not feel whole at all.” If you were the Filipina nurse, would you decide and act the same way? Why?</a>

Neighbors are no longer people I meet &amp; greet, And colleagues have now become occasional struggles, What's more? The outbreak has truly destroyed our livelihoods, Leaving us with nothing but hope. Hope for all of this to end, Hope for a miracle in these unsolicited times, While we push ourselves to the core, To stay alive in this uproar. MAKE BELIEVEJ NON-FACT IMAGE REAL FACT IMAGE​</a>

What happened or why did you feel that way? What is your relation with that person? If some random people or strangers were involved in the situation you feel the same way? Would you feel the same level of sadness or remorse? I believe it will not feel the same way because you do not have that mos relationship unlike the former persons involved. Like what they say.

This is a sacred ceremony for a couple that promise and exchange vows before the Lord. They disobeyed the commandments of the Lord. God created man for woman.Mrs. Casiana: (Member in the society)It is awkward to hear that same sexes were married. How could they produce children? Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake. Mr. Serge: (Gay)I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally. Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is meant for him.

Neighbors are no longer people I meet &amp; greet, And colleagues have now become occasional struggles, What's more?

Even though they loved each other, but for me it is a mistake. Mr. Serge: (Gay)I agree on these proposal, in a sense that I could feel secured and have peace of mind. And I would also feel full of happiness because my love one and I will live together in a legal way.Ms. Emyang: (Lesbian)It is alright for me. There’s no such mistake of having an affair with same sex, because we cannot resist that love that we felt, whatever gender it is, as long as you live with her with happiness and feel comfortable of being companion, well it’s good. So much good if you both live in a legal way or have married legally. Ms. Jennifer: (Parent of a gay)If that proposal would be a law, I would just let my son-gay to marry a man if he thinks that a man is meant for him.
