And they usually go once a week. Ana always gets pesto, and her little sister always gets carbonara. Their parents like to try different things. One week when they were getting ready to go out for dinner, Ana's father suggested to eat in a different restaurant. Ana and her sister Gaca groaned. The new restaurant was Filipino inspired. The two are not a fan of grilled food. "Let's try it once, and if you don't like it, we will go back to your tried and tested favorite restaurant next week." The two children got into the backseat of the car. When they arrived at the restaurant, a host met them at the door, greeted them and led them to a table and said, "Happy to serve, we hope that you will love what is on the menu tonight." The two The restaurant was very nice and their servers as well. The waiter came out with the food that they ordered children did not notice how big their smiles were when they saw the viands being served. There was kare-kare, fried chicken and pork barbeque. The family was full in no time. I think I have another favorite place to dine," said Ana. "Can we switch between the two restaurants for our weekly dinner?" asked Gaea. "That is a great idea." said Ana's mother. What type of restaurant was Ana's favorite? Why would Anna and Gaca have groaned about trying a new estaurant? What food did they order?​</a>

What do we mean when we say we believe?" Is it always about evidences? Most of us adhere to the
saying exist but we
believe sise. We know that air is real although we do not see it. Then there is love and faith. Saying the
believe is an affirmation that we have faith. But what is faith? It is a personal decision and involves the voluele
prayer and worship person. It includes the head or knowledge of God, the hands or our actions, and the heart expressed in our
That is why Jesus, in the Gospel, said to Thomas, "Happy are those who believe even without seeing
evidence. Continuing to believe makes a person convinced and certain of his or her faith and that's what
makes a Christian fortunate and happy. We believe not so much because there are convincing evidences
presented to us but because we trust God, the Giver of faith, whom we know does not and cannot be
deceived.
Similarly, it does not mean that faith is "blind acceptance. So then, faith involves believing, doing, and
prayerful trusting. It is not just knowing God but it is expressing that knowledge in our actions, and that same
knowledge will serve as our "security blanket" in whatever we do and whatever we go through. Faith that is
lived and celebrated in worship is a force within us that, by the power of the Holy Spirit, gradually works a
transformation in our daily thoughts, hopes, attitudes, and values.

We have positive experiences that make us feel good and happy, like winning in a school competition, celebrating a milestone, and receiving gifts or praise from other people.

These positive and negative experiences can serve as our guide and inspiration in achieving success. Through these experiences we learn from our distakes and we realize the value of our decisions. Here are some tips to success using the LADDER: 1:11 Leam from experiences and make it a point that you continue and move on whatever challenges you may encounter.

Discipline should be observed in your thoughts and actions. This is an important aspect of learning that would help you in your everyday life. 11. Dream big and de better. Always remember successful people dreamed first to become successful. Explore. Discover new things and be open to all possibilities. Do not be afraid to join in organizations or try to learn new skills. Responsible. Be responsible for all the decisions you will make.​</a>

believe sise. We know that air is real although we do not see it. Then there is love and faith. Saying the
believe is an affirmation that we have faith. But what is faith? It is a personal decision and involves the voluele
prayer and worship person. It includes the head or knowledge of God, the hands or our actions, and the heart expressed in our
That is why Jesus, in the Gospel, said to Thomas, "Happy are those who believe even without seeing
evidence. Continuing to believe makes a person convinced and certain of his or her faith and that's what
makes a Christian fortunate and happy. We believe not so much because there are convincing evidences
presented to us but because we trust God, the Giver of faith, whom we know does not and cannot be
deceived.
Similarly, it does not mean that faith is "blind acceptance. So then, faith involves believing, doing, and
prayerful trusting. It is not just knowing God but it is expressing that knowledge in our actions, and that same
knowledge will serve as our "security blanket" in whatever we do and whatever we go through. Faith that is
lived and celebrated in worship is a force within us that, by the power of the Holy Spirit, gradually works a
transformation in our daily thoughts, hopes, attitudes, and values.

In our time, our parents were not afraid to spank us. Our TV hours were closely monitored. We were taught to respect our elders and eat what was served in front of us.
