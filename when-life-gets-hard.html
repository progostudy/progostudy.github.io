                                              Why should life be fair to you? The fact that you are reading this, means you have food to eat, access to shelter, clothing, access to a computer and internet which approximately means you have some edge over some people around the world that has one thought — food.A lot of people complain about how life is unfair and how things went bad in their life. But hey, life was meant to be so, you just have to embrace it and not take it as the cake you can always have.You don’t expect life to be fair to you because you are a good person or you work so hard. Life has its own rules, it’s complicated and not the same for everyone.  If you tried once and failed then definitely you will discover that life is unfair. Life was not intended for those who try only once then give up but instead, it’s orchestrated for the determined and strong-minded people who keep trying until they get what they want.  Because life isn’t fair doesn’t mean you should give up and keep asking why. Life is a never-ending race of learning. When bad things happen to you (or when something good doesn’t happen to you every time), it may not just be something bad happening to you. It might be a chance to learn something new — about yourself, about the way the world works, the people around you which would propel you to a new level.​</a>

For you to be able to apply the biographical context of Steven Paul Job, try to read another story written by him.
LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

                                            health is wealth.there is nothing in our life that is more valuable than health. without health, there is no peace, no success and no happiness When we are ill, we do not want to work or play. Health robs us of good sleep and appetite. Life becomes a burden for a person who is sick all the time. He feels tired of life and always complains about something. But a person with good health enjoys his life. He never gets tired of work or play. He enjoys the beauty of the world and is happy with everything. He is able to work hard to make his dreams become a reality. He never complains and is always happy and cheerful. He may be poor, he may have to work hard to earn his living, but even the richest ma will envy him for his good health So, I believe that the saying, "Health is Wealth" is very true.1.

Why Snakes Shed Skin Snakes shed their skin to allow for further growth. The top layer of a snake's skin doesn't grow, but its body does. So as a snake gets bigger during its life, it has to get rid of the top layer and leaves it behind. They scrape their bodies against rocks, trees, the ground, and many other things until they can slither out of their old skin. When they're ready to shed the old layer, they create a rip in the old skin, usually in the mouth or nose area. They often do this by rubbing against a rough, hard object, such as a rock or a log. The snake repeats this process of skin shedding until it has stopped growing (Wonderopolis.org, 2020).​</a>

I worked hard to get to this point of my life and working even harder to get to the successful and graduate part of my life. I care more for some others than I do myself but I have a huge nonchalant attitude. I don’t really show anger or sadness much I always smile because I’m optimistic about life. I look at life as if something bad comes along, no need to dwell on it you can’t take it back so just move-on and improve what you did wrong if it’s possible.…show more content…
I was taught to be caring and thoughtful; I wasn’t taught anything else from anyone other than not to trust people. I’m the odd ball of my family because I am nothing like anyone. I can say I was also taught to believe in myself and never down myself because I can accomplish anything. That is shown through my determination and hard work because if I didn’t believe in myself I wouldn’t try as hard. Last but not all, Humanistic approach sums up my personality a little more than psychodynamic does because it involves nature vs. nurture and that kind of sums it up just saying that. Environment and Heredity is kind of the main reasons of my attitudes and actions. In the article, Time-Limited Psychodynamic Psychotherapy, Briggs conducts different forms of psychotherapy techniques to prove whether things in an adolescent’s life effect different adolescents differently. His study was a success and proved that many adolescents have different interpretations on the same issue. He read them off different problems and wanted to see how they would interpret them. He used children in the age groups of 12-17 and it worked out. I think that the different approaches can be brought together in some circumstances but in my case it doesn’t. My personality makes more sense coming from the humanistic approach. Briggs, Stephen (2010).</a>

Younger kids need at least 9 hours of sleep every night. After school- activities can take away from sleep time for kids. Also parents with busy life styles stay up late and their kidsdo the same.Kids with little sleep have hard time sleeping at night and this will affect their daily routine and makethem less active and productive through the day in schoolMost parents are not aware of what goes on when their kids go to sleep and how the brain works whenwe are asleepMany people think that the brain shuts down when we go to sleep but it is the opposite.

Write the details on the space provided to complete the summaryI do well in school, and people think I am smart because of it But it's not true. In fact,three years ago I struggled in school. However, two years ago I decided to get seriousabout school and made a few changes. First, I decided I would become interested inwhatever was being taught, regardless of what other people thought I also decided iwould work hard every day and never give up on any assignment. I decided to never,never fall behind. Finally, I decided to make school a priority over friends and fun. AfterImplementing these changes, I became an active participant in classroom discussions,Then my test scores began to rise. I still remember the first time that someone made funof me because I was smart." How exciting! It seems to me that being smart is simply amatter of working hard and being interested. After all, learning a new video game ishard work even when you are interested. Unfortunately, learning a new video gamedoesn't help you get into college or get a good job.​SUMMARY:people in school think I am smart because____________________.

                            6.   Why should life be fair to you? The fact that you are reading this, means you have food to eat, access to shelter, clothing, access to a computer and internet which approximately means you have some edge over some people around the world that has one thought — food.A lot of people complain about how life is unfair and how things went bad in their life. But hey, life was meant to be so, you just have to embrace it and not take it as the cake you can always have.You don’t expect life to be fair to you because you are a good person or you work so hard. Life has its own rules, it’s complicated and not the same for everyone.  If you tried once and failed then definitely you will discover that life is unfair. Life was not intended for those who try only once then give up but instead, it’s orchestrated for the determined and strong-minded people who keep trying until they get what they want.  Because life isn’t fair doesn’t mean you should give up and keep asking why. Life is a never-ending race of learning. When bad things happen to you (or when something good doesn’t happen to you every time), it may not just be something bad happening to you. It might be a chance to learn something new — about yourself, about the way the world works, the people around you which would propel you to a new level.​</h2><br />

LOVE &amp; LOSS
 My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky — I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents’ garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation — the Macintosh — a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.

Health robs us of good sleep and appetite. Life becomes a burden for a person who is sick all the time. He feels tired of life and always complains about something. But a person with good health enjoys his life. He never gets tired of work or play. He enjoys the beauty of the world and is happy with everything. He is able to work hard to make his dreams become a reality. He never complains and is always happy and cheerful. He may be poor, he may have to work hard to earn his living, but even the richest ma will envy him for his good health So, I believe that the saying, "Health is Wealth" is very true.1.

Why Snakes Shed Skin Snakes shed their skin to allow for further growth. The top layer of a snake's skin doesn't grow, but its body does. So as a snake gets bigger during its life, it has to get rid of the top layer and leaves it behind. They scrape their bodies against rocks, trees, the ground, and many other things until they can slither out of their old skin. When they're ready to shed the old layer, they create a rip in the old skin, usually in the mouth or nose area. They often do this by rubbing against a rough, hard object, such as a rock or a log. The snake repeats this process of skin shedding until it has stopped growing (Wonderopolis.org, 2020).​</h2><br />

I like to look at myself as a genuine, thoughtful young lady. I’m a hard worker; I believe nothing is ever handed to you so you have to go get it. I worked hard to get to this point of my life and working even harder to get to the successful and graduate part of my life. I care more for some others than I do myself but I have a huge nonchalant attitude. I don’t really show anger or sadness much I always smile because I’m optimistic about life. I look at life as if something bad comes along, no need to dwell on it you can’t take it back so just move-on and improve what you did wrong if it’s possible.…show more content…
I was taught to be caring and thoughtful; I wasn’t taught anything else from anyone other than not to trust people. I’m the odd ball of my family because I am nothing like anyone. I can say I was also taught to believe in myself and never down myself because I can accomplish anything. That is shown through my determination and hard work because if I didn’t believe in myself I wouldn’t try as hard. Last but not all, Humanistic approach sums up my personality a little more than psychodynamic does because it involves nature vs. nurture and that kind of sums it up just saying that. Environment and Heredity is kind of the main reasons of my attitudes and actions. In the article, Time-Limited Psychodynamic Psychotherapy, Briggs conducts different forms of psychotherapy techniques to prove whether things in an adolescent’s life effect different adolescents differently. His study was a success and proved that many adolescents have different interpretations on the same issue. He read them off different problems and wanted to see how they would interpret them. He used children in the age groups of 12-17 and it worked out. I think that the different approaches can be brought together in some circumstances but in my case it doesn’t. My personality makes more sense coming from the humanistic approach. Briggs, Stephen (2010).</h2><br />

Write the details on the space provided to complete the summaryI do well in school, and people think I am smart because of it But it's not true. In fact,three years ago I struggled in school. However, two years ago I decided to get seriousabout school and made a few changes. First, I decided I would become interested inwhatever was being taught, regardless of what other people thought I also decided iwould work hard every day and never give up on any assignment. I decided to never,never fall behind. Finally, I decided to make school a priority over friends and fun. AfterImplementing these changes, I became an active participant in classroom discussions,Then my test scores began to rise. I still remember the first time that someone made funof me because I was smart." How exciting! It seems to me that being smart is simply amatter of working hard and being interested. After all, learning a new video game ishard work even when you are interested. Unfortunately, learning a new video gamedoesn't help you get into college or get a good job.​SUMMARY:people in school think I am smart because____________________.
