                                            Lesson 3 UNIVERSAL SET AND SUBSETS You have illustrated cardinality of sets. A set may be finite or infinite. It depends on the number of element/s it contain/s. How about if we have a set whose elements are the elements of another set? What do we call this set Can you illustrate subset? Can you illustrate universal set? 1. Objective: After performing the activities here in this lesson, you are expected to illustrate universal set and subset. II. Vocabulary List The universal set, U, is the set that contains all elements under consideration. If all the elements of set A are also elements of set B, then A is a subset of B. This means that subsets can be created from any defined universal set. The set of natural numbers itself is a subset of the set of real numbers, which could be another example of a universal set. Equal sets have the same element, even though they could be out of order. Thus, it has equal cardinality. Equivalent sets have different element but have the same amount of element. Remember: Equal sets are always an equivalent set. Equivalent sets may or may not an equal set. III. Learning Activities A. Most of us love to eat ice cream. Below are the different flavors of ice cream we can choose from. What are the possible sets of flavors of ice cream we can have? teachin Vurpose only Not Butter Sale Chocolate Vanilla The table below lists the possible flavor or flavors of ice cream we can choose from the available flavors: If you chose None of the 3 flavors If we chose Any one chocolate Butter vanilla If you chose Any If we chose All three two chocolate, butter chocolate, butter, vanilla butter, vanilla chocolate, vanilla Using the table, illustrate the possible flavor or flavors of ice cream in a set: 1.

                                            Biology indeed offered us great adventures as we learn greatly about life! It
teaches us to know how the traits were passed from parents to offspring. Also, it
helps us to realize that we are products of a very small biomolecule which is
scientifically known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This minute biomolecule serves
as the language for genetic interpretation and we exist on what we are and what we
should look like because of the codes printed in our DNA.
Due to the advent of modern technology, our knowledge about DNA goes
beyond from what we know about it before. Scientists and field experts can now enter
and modify the codes printed in our DNA. Does it sound like magic? It’s not magic,
it’s science! They can now manipulate the traits to produce new traits and expected
traits. Science indeed did not stop surprising us.
We live in a world where some fictions from sci – fi movies could possibly
become science. An example of this is a scientific study made by some physicians,
geneticists, and embryologists from United States, Japan, and Europe. Because of
their studies about preimplantation genetic diagnosis and gene – altering
technologies, you can now learn, as you become a parent, your child’s sex and
discover the traits they inherited and possessed as they grow up. Also, you can now
choose your children’s traits instead of leaving those traits in nature. Because of
these studies, physicians can now routinely test embryos of different donors for
hundreds of genes and use these embryos for soon – to – be – parents and child –
bearing – want – to – be – parents to pick embryos with genes that inhibit diseases
or to pick the sex of their future progeny.
So far so good, right? But behind these good benefits, the controversy is
swirling around gene – altering techniques that poses ethical and social dilemmas
that more and more people are now facing. And for all the issues surrounding gene
editing techniques, these scientific developments of modifying humankind should
prompt us to realize that science is no longer a thing that we know in the past or a
fictional stuff of the future. It is a reality that we must all now face.
In your point of view as a senior high school STEM student, should gene
editing be performed on human embryos? Is micromanipulation of gametes and
embryos helpful or can make a permanent change to society? Explain your answer
using the concepts that you have learned from this module.</a>

                                            Activity 2 Imagine that you've just turned on your TV. You see a man in a suit standing in front of a large map with the symbols of a sun, clouds, and thunder. What do you think is he about to tell you? Most likely, this is going to be a weather forecast. You can expect to hear words like 'sunny, 'windy,' and 'overcast. You'll probably hear the use of verbs in the future tense such as "It will be a cold start to the day" or "There will be showers in the afternoon" and others. Depending on the context-a news report, a school lecture, an exchange in a supermarket-you can often predict the kind of words and the style of language that the speaker will use. Our knowledge of the world helps us anticipate the kind of information we are likely to hear. moreover, when we predict the topic of a talk or a conversation, all the related vocabulary stored in our brains is activated to help us better understand what we're listening to. Give your prediction on each of the given situations. Justify your answer. 1. What should we do to avoid such a calamity from happening? cite examples. 2. what would happen if plants and animals under the sea become extinct? why? ​</a>

                                            What is the difference of a Weather and a Climate
We hear about weather and climate all of the time. Most of us check the local weather forecast to plan our days. And climate change is certainly a “hot” topic in the news. There is, however, still a lot of confusion over the difference between the two.
Think about it this way: Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get.
Weather is what you see outside on any particular day. So, for example, it may be 75° degrees and sunny or it could be 20° degrees with heavy snow. That’s the weather.
Climate is the average of that weather. For example, you can expect snow in the Northeast in January or for it to be hot and humid in the Southeast in July. This is climate. The climate record also includes extreme values such as record high temperatures or record amounts of rainfall. If you’ve ever heard your local weather person say “today we hit a record high for this day,” she is talking about climate records.
So when we are talking about climate change, we are talking about changes in long-term averages of daily weather. In most places, weather can change from minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, day-to-day, and season-to-season. Climate, however, is the average of weather over time and space.</a>

                            5. Lesson 3 UNIVERSAL SET AND SUBSETS You have illustrated cardinality of sets. A set may be finite or infinite. It depends on the number of element/s it contain/s. How about if we have a set whose elements are the elements of another set? What do we call this set Can you illustrate subset? Can you illustrate universal set? 1. Objective: After performing the activities here in this lesson, you are expected to illustrate universal set and subset. II. Vocabulary List The universal set, U, is the set that contains all elements under consideration. If all the elements of set A are also elements of set B, then A is a subset of B. This means that subsets can be created from any defined universal set. The set of natural numbers itself is a subset of the set of real numbers, which could be another example of a universal set. Equal sets have the same element, even though they could be out of order. Thus, it has equal cardinality. Equivalent sets have different element but have the same amount of element. Remember: Equal sets are always an equivalent set. Equivalent sets may or may not an equal set. III. Learning Activities A. Most of us love to eat ice cream. Below are the different flavors of ice cream we can choose from.

                            10. Biology indeed offered us great adventures as we learn greatly about life! It
teaches us to know how the traits were passed from parents to offspring. Also, it
helps us to realize that we are products of a very small biomolecule which is
scientifically known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This minute biomolecule serves
as the language for genetic interpretation and we exist on what we are and what we
should look like because of the codes printed in our DNA.
Due to the advent of modern technology, our knowledge about DNA goes
beyond from what we know about it before. Scientists and field experts can now enter
and modify the codes printed in our DNA. Does it sound like magic? It’s not magic,
it’s science! They can now manipulate the traits to produce new traits and expected
traits. Science indeed did not stop surprising us.
We live in a world where some fictions from sci – fi movies could possibly
become science. An example of this is a scientific study made by some physicians,
geneticists, and embryologists from United States, Japan, and Europe. Because of
their studies about preimplantation genetic diagnosis and gene – altering
technologies, you can now learn, as you become a parent, your child’s sex and
discover the traits they inherited and possessed as they grow up. Also, you can now
choose your children’s traits instead of leaving those traits in nature. Because of
these studies, physicians can now routinely test embryos of different donors for
hundreds of genes and use these embryos for soon – to – be – parents and child –
bearing – want – to – be – parents to pick embryos with genes that inhibit diseases
or to pick the sex of their future progeny.
So far so good, right? But behind these good benefits, the controversy is
swirling around gene – altering techniques that poses ethical and social dilemmas
that more and more people are now facing. And for all the issues surrounding gene
editing techniques, these scientific developments of modifying humankind should
prompt us to realize that science is no longer a thing that we know in the past or a
fictional stuff of the future. It is a reality that we must all now face.
In your point of view as a senior high school STEM student, should gene
editing be performed on human embryos? Is micromanipulation of gametes and
embryos helpful or can make a permanent change to society? Explain your answer
using the concepts that you have learned from this module.</h2><br />
                        <p>The cell is the basic unit of life. All organisms are composed of one or more cells. As will be discussed later, humans are made up of many millions of cells. In order to understand what goes wrong in cancer, it is important to understand how normal cells work. The first step is to discuss the structure and basic functions of cells.</p><p></p><p>First we will introduce the common building blocks of cells. All cells, regardless of their function or location in the body, share common features and processes. Amazingly, cells are comprised almost entirely of just four basic types of molecules. Shown above is a cell surrounded by examples of these building block molecules.</p><p></p><p>Since they are present in living things these building blocks are called biomolecules.

                            19. Do you know who you are? When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? The best version of yourself? A façade? A blank picture of yourself? Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life. Remembering and believing who we are,. is just the start of living life to the fullest again this is the first step. Next is to live the truth. You are created for a purpose and thus loved by God. With this, you will experience healing inside and your completeness through Him will then radiate love and joy to others too. No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.

                            23. Do you know who you are? When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? The best version of yourself? A façade? A blank picture of yourself? Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life. Remembering and believing who we are,. is just the start of living life to the fullest again this is the first step. Next is to live the truth. You are created for a purpose and thus loved by God. With this, you will experience healing inside and your completeness through Him will then radiate love and joy to others too. No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.

                            27. Activity 2 Imagine that you've just turned on your TV. You see a man in a suit standing in front of a large map with the symbols of a sun, clouds, and thunder. What do you think is he about to tell you? Most likely, this is going to be a weather forecast. You can expect to hear words like 'sunny, 'windy,' and 'overcast. You'll probably hear the use of verbs in the future tense such as "It will be a cold start to the day" or "There will be showers in the afternoon" and others. Depending on the context-a news report, a school lecture, an exchange in a supermarket-you can often predict the kind of words and the style of language that the speaker will use. Our knowledge of the world helps us anticipate the kind of information we are likely to hear. moreover, when we predict the topic of a talk or a conversation, all the related vocabulary stored in our brains is activated to help us better understand what we're listening to. Give your prediction on each of the given situations. Justify your answer. 1. What should we do to avoid such a calamity from happening? cite examples. 2. what would happen if plants and animals under the sea become extinct? why? ​</h2><br />

                            30. What is the difference of a Weather and a Climate
We hear about weather and climate all of the time. Most of us check the local weather forecast to plan our days. And climate change is certainly a “hot” topic in the news. There is, however, still a lot of confusion over the difference between the two.
Think about it this way: Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get.
Weather is what you see outside on any particular day. So, for example, it may be 75° degrees and sunny or it could be 20° degrees with heavy snow. That’s the weather.
Climate is the average of that weather. For example, you can expect snow in the Northeast in January or for it to be hot and humid in the Southeast in July. This is climate. The climate record also includes extreme values such as record high temperatures or record amounts of rainfall. If you’ve ever heard your local weather person say “today we hit a record high for this day,” she is talking about climate records.
So when we are talking about climate change, we are talking about changes in long-term averages of daily weather. In most places, weather can change from minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour, day-to-day, and season-to-season. Climate, however, is the average of weather over time and space.</h2><br />
                        weather is the condition of the place in that time<br />while the climate is the condition of the place in spicific  time<br />
