Two women passed. One said to the other “Look at that selfish old fellow, riding while his little son follows on foot!” The man then took the boy up behind him. The next traveler they met asked the man, “Is the donkey yours?” “Yes, it’s ours.” The man said, “No one would think so from the way you use it. Why, you are better able to carry the donkey than it is to carry both of you.” So, the man tied the donkey’s legs to a pole. Staggering under the weights, they carried it into town. There, they were greeted with much laughter. The man got angry and threw the donkey into the river. Seizing his son by the arm, they set off home.Read and write the letter of your answer as to the mood, tone and purpose suggested by the expression.11.

                                            ( Identify the Setiing, Conflict, Character, plot, theme, resolution.I have cried bitterly only twice in my life: once when my old girlfriend left me and once when my cat died. Mop was very special to me. Her death taught me not to delay getting proper care for loved ones.Mop came into my life as a kitten. Her mother died when she was very small, so I raised her all by myself. I took her to work every day and gave her milk every hour for two or three weeks until she was big enough to stay home. When Mop was two or three years old, I took in a stray Tom cat and Mop soon got pregnant. Mop got sick shortly after she had kittens. Her kittens all died and she got weaker and weaker. She ate and drank very little and spent most of her time lying on the floor and staring into space. I thought about taking her to the vet, but I did not want to spend all that money and I hoped that she would eventually just get well on her own. Finally, she looked so sick and unhappy that I gave in and took her to the vet. He said she was too far gone and would soon die. I took her home and watched her carefully. A day or two later, she died in my arms. As I held her thin body in my hands, I remembered all the fun we had and the times I was mean to her. I felt my heart breaking and I cried hard for ten minutes. Then I wrapped her in a plastic bag and took her to Monkey Mountain, where I buried her in an unmarked grave beside a trail.I felt bad about waiting so long to take Mop to the vet and I decided that if any of my pets or family members got sick, I would not wait to take them to the doctor. If I had acted sooner, Mop might still be alive, or at least she would not have suffered so much for so long.</a>

                                            Learning Task 3 Reading ComprehensionSolids, Liquids, and GasesMatter is basically a substance that takes up space. All matter is a solid, liquid, or gas, and they arecalled the states of matterEverywhere a person looks, there are examples of solids: desks, hairs, windows, rocks, tissues, andmuch more. Examples of liquids: water, milk, juice, chocolate sy up, soda, and others. Examples ofgases are harder to see, because they are invisible: the oxygen in the air, propane gas used for agrill, helium inside a balloon, and more.Everything, all matter, can be identified as a solid, liquid, or gas.Besides what they look like, there are many differences betwee i solids, liquids, and gases. Thesedifferences are called characteristics. The characteristics of each state of matter are different. Thesecharacteristics determine if a substance is a solid, liquid, or gas.A solid has a definite shape. It can be hard or soft, smooth or roi gh. Solids can come in all sizes. Asolid can be large like the Statue of Liberty, or small like a marble. It can be very tiny like a breadcrumb, or as big as a mountain, and everything in between. If snall enough, solids can be held in aperson's hand, and they are difficult to compress or push, or charge shape.The molecules of a solid are compact and close together, and nearly impossible to move throughA liquid takes the shape of the container it is held in, and will fil the bottom of a container. Liquidsusually have a smooth surface, but does not have a specific size. A person may be able to hold asmall amount of liquid in their hand, but a liquid cannot be held like a solid. Liquids are less difficult tocompress or push. It is much easier to move through a liquid thar a solid.The molecules of a liquid are spread out more than a solid, but less than a gas.Finally, a gas has ng shape, but can fill a container or any size or shape. It will fill an entire containeras the molecules move. A gas cannot be felt in the hands like a solid or liquid. It has no surface or noparticular size. It cannot be held in a person's hands, and it is easy to push or compress. A gas is theeasiest to move through versus a liquid or solid.The molecules in a gas are more spread out and move all the time. They are full of energy.Water is the best example of a substance that can be a solid, liqu d. or gas. Water by itself is a liquid.When water freezes it becomes a solid. If a container of water is h rated it turns into a gas called watervapor.There are many other substances that can be more than one type of matter too. Ice cream is solidthen turns into liquid, once melted. A moth ball is solid, but it rele: ses a gas that can be smelled by aperson inside the room.To summarize, the different states of matter are called solids, liqu ds, and gases.

Two women passed. One said to the other “Look at that selfish old fellow, riding while his little son follows on foot!” The man then took the boy up behind him. The next traveler they met asked the man, “Is the donkey yours?” “Yes, it’s ours.” The man said, “No one would think so from the way you use it. Why, you are better able to carry the donkey than it is to carry both of you.” So, the man tied the donkey’s legs to a pole. Staggering under the weights, they carried it into town. There, they were greeted with much laughter. The man got angry and threw the donkey into the river. Seizing his son by the arm, they set off home.Read and write the letter of your answer as to the mood, tone and purpose suggested by the expression.11.

( Identify the Setiing, Conflict, Character, plot, theme, resolution.I have cried bitterly only twice in my life: once when my old girlfriend left me and once when my cat died. Mop was very special to me. Her death taught me not to delay getting proper care for loved ones.Mop came into my life as a kitten. Her mother died when she was very small, so I raised her all by myself. I took her to work every day and gave her milk every hour for two or three weeks until she was big enough to stay home. When Mop was two or three years old, I took in a stray Tom cat and Mop soon got pregnant. Mop got sick shortly after she had kittens. Her kittens all died and she got weaker and weaker. She ate and drank very little and spent most of her time lying on the floor and staring into space. I thought about taking her to the vet, but I did not want to spend all that money and I hoped that she would eventually just get well on her own. Finally, she looked so sick and unhappy that I gave in and took her to the vet. He said she was too far gone and would soon die. I took her home and watched her carefully. A day or two later, she died in my arms. As I held her thin body in my hands, I remembered all the fun we had and the times I was mean to her. I felt my heart breaking and I cried hard for ten minutes. Then I wrapped her in a plastic bag and took her to Monkey Mountain, where I buried her in an unmarked grave beside a trail.I felt bad about waiting so long to take Mop to the vet and I decided that if any of my pets or family members got sick, I would not wait to take them to the doctor. If I had acted sooner, Mop might still be alive, or at least she would not have suffered so much for so long.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Skip to main content</p><p></p><p>￼</p><p></p><p>English 111</p><p></p><p>Unit 4: Types of Writing</p><p></p><p>Narrative Essays</p><p></p><p>What is Narrative Writing?</p><p></p><p>When you write a book report or tell a story or explain what happened first, second, and third you are giving a narrative account. Narrative writing is commonly used when we want to share our ideas with others. We write about what we like, what’s important to us, and what we think others will enjoy reading. Narrative writing is descriptive writing, but it is not usually associated with academic writing that requires higher-order thinking skills, including the research components described in Bloom’s taxonomy (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation).</p><p>Narrative writing is often associated with fiction writing. We write about people who do things. We write about a struggle and how it is overcome. We usually write from a particular perspective or point of view: “Let me tell you about my first day in public school. It still stands out as one of the worst days of my life…..” or “Going to first grade for me was so exciting! I could hardly wait to get there, and when I look back at that wonderful day with a beautiful teacher and all those new people I’d never seen before, I still get a thrill.”</p><p>You can see from the two above examples that narratives are often written in first person. Readers are encouraged to be a part of the author’s world. They’re invited into that world by the author’s words and images and details. Narrative writing involves vivid, descriptive examples of people and events.</p><p>If you think of narrative writing as storytelling, you can begin a short narrative project. Consider the essential elements of a story: it must have a setting, it must contain characters, there must be a particular plot or story line, a problem (sometimes called ‘conflict’) must come into play to help move the story along, there must eventually be a resolution to the problem, and the story must be told from someone’s perspective (or point of view). We’ll look at each of these elements of narrative writing:</p><p></p><p>Setting</p><p></p><p>Characters</p><p></p><p>Plot</p><p></p><p>Problem and Resolution</p><p></p><p>Perspective, often called Point of View</p><p></p><p>Setting</p><p></p><p>￼“It was a dark and stormy night.” There’s a setting for you. Charlie Brown’s dog, Snoopy, began his great American novel with that opening line. It sent chills down every child’s spine just thinking about Snoopy looking out drearily from within the shelter of his dog house!</p><p>A setting must be somewhere. The story you are telling must take place in some specific place at some specific time, whether it’s in a space ship on its way to another galaxy or the attic in your house. It can certainly be an imaginary place, but even imaginary places have to be described. Your reader must have a sense of place. If you’re writing about a log cabin in the woods, is it a vacation cabin that your family rents each summer, with all the modern conveniences (including WiFi), or is it a pioneer family’s crudely-constructed hut quickly built from scavenged logs in the Wyoming wilderness of 1820? The characters and story that you develop are clearly dependent on the setting you develop for the reader.</p><p></p><p>Characters</p><p></p><p>Your setting needs to have characters that do things connected to the place you’ve put them in. If you’re writing about dogs and cats, you don’t necessarily need people. In that case, the dogs and cats are your characters. If you do have people, they’ll be interacting with each other in some way. Dogs, cats, and people (and any characters you create) will have names and personalities and they will speak to each other and deal with all the situations in your story.</p><p>You may be very creative with your characters, assigning very particular characteristics to each. You need main characters and supporting characters. Your narrative will be about a person or two or three people who interact within the plot of your narrative. Characters can be heroic “protagonists” and their arch enemies, the “antagonists,” who are out to get them. Characters are needed to move the story through the events needed to get from the beginning to the end.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
