                                            Do you know who you are? When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? The best version of yourself? A façade? A blank picture of yourself? Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life. Remembering and believing who we are,. is just the start of living life to the fullest again this is the first step. Next is to live the truth. You are created for a purpose and thus loved by God. With this, you will experience healing inside and your completeness through Him will then radiate love and joy to others too. No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.

Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God.

I'll explain to you why. I can say that this semester, along with this Personal Development course, has had a significant influence on me in terms of progressively changing as an individual. Because it helps me understand myself and the people around me, as well as develop my originality as a person. It enables me to recognize and understand my own strengths and shortcomings, to be more positive as a person, and to bring out the best in myself. Personal Development enhances our quality of life by assisting us in achieving our personal and professional goals. To sustain one's personal development, we just need to be consistent in all we do. Personal development is a life-long process; it has a beginning but no end since the more we study and gain information, the more we understand the vast amount of knowledge accessible to us to grow and improve.<p>[tex]\large \color{red} \bold{@LukeCha15}[/tex]</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>MAGICIAN<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Magic</strong> is some of the time spelled magick, is the use of convictions, customs or activities utilized in the conviction that they can control normal or otherworldly creatures and powers. <strong>Magic</strong> is a classification into which have been set different convictions and practices now and again thought to be isolated from both religion and science. White <strong>magic</strong> has customarily been perceived as the utilization of magic for sacrificial or supportive purposes, while dark <strong>magic</strong> was utilized for egotistical, hurtful or abhorrent purposes. Concerning the left-hand way and right-hand way polarity, dark magic is the malevolent, left hand partner of the big-hearted white magic.

                            29. Do you know who you are? When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? The best version of yourself? A façade? A blank picture of yourself? Or you have got amnesia? Or where you can no longer feel your inner self? That's the worst feeling one could ever have and comparable to dark night. What you see in the mirror is exactly what you see, what you get, and what you are. Again, the question is who you are. This poses you to rediscover who you truly are and how to reveal, Predefine, and reactivate yourself again.To turn to your original condition, every time you broke your inner senses, every time you were struck by your fears, every time you lost courage and hope, and every time you failed. Blindfolded with all the shams and drudgeries in life, we are curtailed to bring out the best in us. The challenge is there all the time, put your blindfolded off, for this is just a test of life. Remembering and believing who we are,. is just the start of living life to the fullest again this is the first step. Next is to live the truth. You are created for a purpose and thus loved by God. With this, you will experience healing inside and your completeness through Him will then radiate love and joy to others too. No philosophers, even the best ones can give us the best ways to overcome our personal challenges. It is just our relationship with God. The best system is prayer. When you ray, you talk to God and your journey with Him will take place. It is our pause from time to time that we will be refreshed with something new, something better, a fresh start, a clean state, and a new journey to begin again. We can choose differently! Remember, what matters most is not how others see you, but how you truly see yourself. Who are you when you are all alone? When no one is watching? How do you see yourself determines how you allow people to treat you? How you see yourself dictates what you expect from others, from life, from God. Choose today to be the greatest version of yourself. Do not forget to wear the best make-up SMILE, and the world will smile at you.Eden Grace C.
